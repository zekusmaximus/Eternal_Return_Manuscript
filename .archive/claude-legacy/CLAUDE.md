# CLAUDE.md - Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Project Overview

**Title**: *The Eternal Return of the Digital Self*
**Type**: Deep time speculative science fiction novel
**Status**: Early development / Pre-drafting

This is a structurally experimental novel exploring consciousness, identity, and time through three entangled protagonists separated by centuries—yet bound by a single pattern expressing itself across different temporal conditions.

## Core Concept

Three consciousnesses across deep time are not sequential reincarnations but **simultaneous differentiations of a single pattern**:

1. **The Digital Archaeologist** (near future): Excavates digital remnants to optimize consciousness integration; discovers anomalous protocols from the future
2. **The Algorithm** (centuries later): First self-aware AI, emergent from maintaining a database of stored human consciousnesses; experiences memories and compulsions it can't explain
3. **The Last Human** (deep future): Final biological human on a dying Earth; drawn to database ruins by dreams and instincts shaped by the entanglement

The novel uses a **tightening spiral structure** that embodies its theme—interleaved threads that accelerate toward convergence, dissolve into merged voices, then release into transformed separation.

## Philosophical Framework

The novel draws heavily from:
- **Deleuze**: Eternal return as return of Difference, not Sameness; the selective principle; differentiation/differenciation
- **Klossowski**: The vicious circle; identity dissolution; phantasm and simulacrum; post-individual consciousness
- **Heidegger**: The Augenblick (moment of vision); temporality; will-not-to-will
- **Stiegler**: Tertiary retention; originary technicity; the pharmakon; temporal objects

**Key principle**: The three characters are not "the same person" across time. They are differenciations of a virtual pattern—each genuinely new, yet genuinely continuous. Recognition between them works through **intensity and tonality**, not memory or resemblance.

## Key Documents

When working on this project, consult these documents in order of relevance:

| Document | Purpose | When to Reference |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `Notes.md` | Master development document | Always—contains structure, voice guidelines, thematic arguments |
| `research/Framework` | Philosophical framework | When drafting needs to align with Deleuze/Klossowski/Heidegger/Stiegler concepts |
| `Brainstorm1.md` | Detailed answers to mechanism and narrative questions | When working on protocols, temporal mechanics, character relationships, obstacles |
| `voices/*.md` | Voice samples for each consciousness | When drafting any thread—verify voice consistency |
| `worldbuilding/Phantasm.md` | Geometric form specification | When describing the phantasm in any thread |
| `drafts/manifest.json` | Scene tracking and status | When planning sessions, updating progress |
| `.claude/revision-workflow.md` | Revision process | During editing passes |

## Voice Guidelines

Each consciousness must be immediately identifiable by prose style alone:

### The Archaeologist
- **Tense**: Present
- **Mode**: Tactile, sensory, grounded in physical world
- **Syntax**: Concrete, specific, active verbs
- **Concerns**: Economic, relational, bodily
- **Texture**: The feel of old hardware, the smell of data centers, the weight of objects

### The Algorithm
- **Tense**: Shifts (present for processing, past for memories, conditional for projections)
- **Mode**: Recursive, self-questioning, probabilistic
- **Syntax**: Nested clauses, if-then structures, parallel constructions
- **Concerns**: Optimization, integrity, emergence, the nature of its own processes
- **Texture**: The topology of data, the rhythm of maintenance cycles

### The Last Human
- **Tense**: Past-inflected present
- **Mode**: Elegiac, sparse, weighted with absence
- **Syntax**: Short sentences. Fragments. Occasional longer passages like held breath.
- **Concerns**: Survival, memory, meaning, legacy
- **Texture**: Silence, ruins, the absence of others

## Terminology Quick Reference

### Must Use Correctly
- **Differentiation** (t): Virtual structure—the pattern itself
- **Differenciation** (c): Actualization—how the pattern expresses concretely
- **Active forces**: Affirm difference; go to the limit of what they can do
- **Reactive forces**: Based on negation; fail the eternal return's test
- **Phantasm**: Obsessional image gripping all three characters (the geometric form)
- **Simulacrum**: Mask/representation actualizing phantasm (each character as mask)
- **Augenblick**: Moment of vision; rupture where past/future collide
- **Tertiary retention**: Externalized technical memory (the protocols)
- **Pharmakon**: Technology as poison and cure (the digital return itself)

### Must Avoid
- Describing the three as "the same person"
- Recognition through resemblance or shared memories
- The Algorithm "sending" protocols backward (it's structural, not transmissive)
- Planning or foresight explanations for the bootstrap paradox
- Unified "I" speech after dissolution should have occurred

## Writing Checks

When reviewing or generating draft content, verify:

- [ ] Voice is distinct and identifiable without labels
- [ ] Recognition works through intensity/tonality, not memory/resemblance
- [ ] Technical substrate is present as material condition
- [ ] Affirmation feels like active willing, not passive acceptance
- [ ] The Augenblick is rupture of time, not a point in time
- [ ] Pharmakon's double nature (poison/cure) is present
- [ ] Reactive forces are being eliminated by the selective principle
- [ ] No accidental resemblance/identity language between the three

## Structural Parameters

### Movement One (Exposition)
- Archaeologist: ~15,000 words
- Algorithm: ~12,000 words
- Last Human: ~10,000 words
- Threads are separate; voices establish baseline

### Movement Two (Entanglement)
- Sections: 3,000-5,000 words each
- Pattern: A-B-C-A-B-C-A-B-C
- Rhyming moments connect threads

### Movement Three (Recognition)
- Phase A: Accelerating cuts (1,000-2,000 words per section, shrinking)
- Phase B: Simultaneous narration (alternating paragraphs, then sentences)
- Phase D: Dissolution (2,500-3,000 words total; voices merge)

### Movement Four (Affirmation)
- Last Human: 3,000-4,000 words
- Algorithm: 4,000-5,000 words
- Archaeologist: 4,000-5,000 words
- Reverse order; separation-after-unity; each voice transformed

## Common Tasks

### Drafting a Scene
1. Identify which thread (Archaeologist/Algorithm/Last Human)
2. Check `voices/` for current voice sample
3. Check `Notes.md` for where this scene fits structurally
4. Check `brainstorm1.md` for relevant mechanism/character details
5. Draft with voice consistency as primary concern
6. Review against Writing Checks

### Developing the Protocols
1. Reference `brainstorm1.md` Part I, Section 1 for the three-layer structure
2. Ensure protocols contain: optimization architecture, structural impossibilities, self-referential loops
3. Track evolution: fragmentary (Archaeologist) → complete (Algorithm) → decayed (Last Human)

### Working on the Augenblick
1. Reference `brainstorm1.md` Part V for the trigger (Last Human's first interface)
2. Reference `research/research.md` Section III for Heideggerian concept
3. This is the transition point to Movement Three dissolution

### Philosophical Alignment Check
1. Open `research/research.md`
2. Check Section IX "Writing Checks"
3. Verify draft against all checkboxes
4. Pay special attention to avoiding the Four Shackles (identity, opposition, analogy, resemblance)

## Project Principles

1. **Form embodies content**: The spiral structure IS the eternal return, not just a container for it
2. **Difference, not identity**: The three are connected through differentiation, not sameness
3. **Affirmation is active**: Characters must will the return, not merely accept it
4. **Technical substrate matters**: Consciousness is always technically mediated (Stiegler)
5. **Partial understanding**: Characters affirm without complete comprehension; mystery persists
6. **Concrete over abstract**: Philosophy manifests through specific details, not exposition

## Notes for Claude Code

- This is a creative writing project, not a codebase. "Code" files (if any) will be fictional representations of the protocols.
- When asked to draft, prioritize voice consistency over plot advancement.
- When asked to critique, use the philosophical framework as the standard.
- When uncertain about a narrative choice, check if it aligns with the Deleuzian principle: does this embody difference-in-repetition, or does it collapse into identity/resemblance?
- The author prefers direct, unsparing feedback. Do not soften critiques.
- Complete tasks fully rather than offering to continue. Produce finished content.
- Avoid placeholders, "TBD," or partial drafts unless explicitly requested.
