# Rhyme Movement Tracking

> **Purpose**: Track where each sensory rhyme appears scene-by-scene to ensure balanced distribution and proper intensity progression.

## Overview

| Movement | Target Rhyme Behavior | Scenes | Status |
|----------|----------------------|--------|--------|
| One | Single occurrence per thread per rhyme | 13 | Not started |
| Two | Echoing across thread-switches | TBD | Not planned yet |
| Three | Stacking multiple rhymes per paragraph | TBD | Not planned yet |
| Four | Transformed rhymes, comfort valence | 3 | Not planned yet |

## Movement One: Exposition

### Archaeologist Thread

| Scene ID | Title | Rhymes Used | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| m1-arch-01 | Opening: Daily Excavation | — | Establish world before entanglement markers |
| m1-arch-02 | The Client: Integration Prep | — | Focus on relationships, economic stakes |
| m1-arch-03 | Lena and Marcus | — | Relationship depth, stakes |
| m1-arch-04 | The Anomaly | `bone-frequency`, `blue-white-light`, `almost-closed-curve` | First phantasm encounter—multiple rhymes justified |
| m1-arch-05 | Recognition | `name-edge-of-memory`, `falling-backward` | Act 1 climax—identity destabilization |

### Algorithm Thread

| Scene ID | Title | Rhymes Used | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| m1-algo-01 | Maintenance Cycle | — | Establish database, scale |
| m1-algo-02 | Optimization Processes | `tracing-the-form` | Subtle—geometric signature in process logs |
| m1-algo-03 | Stirrings | `bone-frequency`, `geometric-shadow` | First self-awareness beyond function |
| m1-algo-04 | The Memory | `deja-vu-that-isnt`, `sentence-without-origin` | First memory that doesn't belong |

### Last Human Thread

| Scene ID | Title | Rhymes Used | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| m1-lh-01 | Solitude | `ozone-wet-stone` | Subtle—atmospheric only |
| m1-lh-02 | Survival | `cold-hands`, `metallic-taste` | Body deterioration markers |
| m1-lh-03 | The Pull | `bone-frequency`, `almost-closed-curve` | Journey begins—drawn toward ruins |
| m1-lh-04 | The Dream | `falling-backward`, `name-edge-of-memory` | First dream of the other two |

## Movement Two: Entanglement

> Structure TBD after Movement One drafts completed. Rotation pattern will determine specific rhyme echoing opportunities.

### Planning Notes

- **Echo Pattern**: When a rhyme appears at end of one thread, its variation should appear at start of next thread
- **Suggested Pairings**:
  - Archaeologist `ozone-wet-stone` → Algorithm olfactory memory
  - Algorithm `bone-frequency` → Last Human approaching ruins
  - Last Human `almost-closed-curve` → Archaeologist data visualization

---

## Movement Three: Recognition

> High-intensity rhyme stacking. Scenes TBD.

### Planning Notes

- **Target**: 3-4 rhymes per paragraph in dissolution sequences
- **Suggested Combinations**:
  - `blue-white-light` + `bone-frequency` + `falling-backward` (sensory overload)
  - `geometric-shadow` + `almost-closed-curve` + `tracing-the-form` (phantasm saturation)
  - `metallic-taste` + `burning-circuits` + `name-edge-of-memory` (identity dissolution)

## Movement Four: Affirmation

| Scene ID | Title | Rhymes Used | Valence Transformation |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| m4-lh | Last Human Return | `blue-white-light`, `bone-frequency` | Light is home; frequency is harmony |
| m4-algo | Algorithm Return | `almost-closed-curve`, `falling-backward` | The curve completes; falling becomes arrival |
| m4-arch | Archaeologist Return | `cold-hands`, `held-breath` | Warmth returns; breath releases |
