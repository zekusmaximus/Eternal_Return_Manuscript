## The Three Threads in Dissolution

### Archaeologist Thread (Residual Markers)

**Last markers present before dissolution:**

| Marker Type | Examples | Count | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Tactile verbs | touch, feel, hold, trace, press | | 1-2 per paragraph max |
| Hardware language | drive, server, interface, data, cold | | 1-2 per paragraph max |
| Economic language | fee, contract, pay, earn | | 1-2 per paragraph max |
| "I find" constructions | I find myself, I find | | Core phrase |
| Present tense | is, are, am, touch, feel | | Contaminated by past/future |

**Dissolution pattern:**
- Markers appear but don't identify speaker
- "I find myself" becomes "I find myself found" (merged)
- Tactile verbs apply to all three bodies simultaneously

---

### Algorithm Thread (Residual Markers)

**Last markers present before dissolution:**

| Marker Type | Examples | Count | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Conditional traces | if, then, when, would, could | | 1-2 per paragraph max |
| Processing vocabulary | process, query, model, optimize, compute | | 1-2 per paragraph max |
| Recursive patterns | processing of processing, modeling of modeling | | 1-2 per paragraph max |
| Self-reference | I find myself found, I process | | Core phrase |
| Tense-shifting | is/was/will be in same sentence | | Temporal collapse |

**Dissolution pattern:**
- Conditionals become statements of fact
- Processing vocabulary applies to consciousness itself
- Self-reference becomes pattern-reference

---

### Last Human Thread (Residual Markers)

**Last markers present before dissolution:**

| Marker Type | Examples | Count | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Sparse syntax | Short sentences. Fragments. | | 1-2 per paragraph max |
| Past-inflection | was, had, walked, remembered | | 1-2 per paragraph max |
| Silence awareness | silence, quiet, absence, alone | | 1-2 per paragraph max |
| Ruins language | ruins, decay, what was, once | | 1-2 per paragraph max |
| Elegiac tone | memory, loss, what remains | | 1-2 per paragraph max |

**Dissolution pattern:**
- Past-inflection merges with present/future
- Silence becomes presence (the pattern)
- Ruins become architecture of consciousness

---

## The Unification Threads (Phase C Only)

### The Pattern Voice

**Characteristics:**
- "I" without clear referent
- "We" emerges as shared perspective
- Temporal collapse: past/present/future simultaneous
- Spatial collapse: server room/ruins/topology as one space

**Key phrases:**
- "I find myself found"
- "The form is what makes self-observation possible"
- "conspiracy of intensities"
- "return of difference"
- "Architect" (surfacing)

**Pronoun distribution targets:**

| Pronoun | Target Count | Function |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| "I" | Ambiguous | The pattern speaking |
| "we" | Min 5 | Shared perspective emergence |
| "the pattern" | 3-5 | Direct naming |
| "something" | 2-3 | Non-specific agency |
