# Voice Reference: The Digital Archaeologist

## Core Voice Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tense** | Present |
| **Mode** | Tactile, sensory, grounded in physical world |
| **Syntax** | Concrete, specific, active verbs |
| **Concerns** | Economic, relational, bodily |
| **Texture** | Hardware, data centers, the weight of objects |

## Identification Test

A reader should identify this voice by:
- Present tense throughout
- Physical sensations and material details
- Economic stakes and work-related concerns
- Active, direct sentence construction
- No recursive self-questioning (Algorithm contamination)
- No elegant sparseness or fragments (Last Human contamination)

## Sample Passages

### Opening Register (Daily Work)

The drive clicks twice before spinning up. Old habit—I hold my breath until I hear data moving. Three terabytes from a dead woman's life, and her children are paying me to make her immortal. The server room hums around me, fans pushing recycled air that smells of ozone and dust. My fingers find the interface by memory. I don't need to look.

The first files load: photographs from forty years back, before the format wars made everything incompatible. She's young in these. Smiling at someone outside the frame. I tag the emotional signatures, let the algorithm weigh them. Love. Certainty. The kind of baseline confidence that integration needs to anchor a personality.

I find her wedding photos first. Always start with love. The algorithm needs anchors.

### Relationship Register (Lena)

Lena's coffee is cold on the counter when I get back. She's at her own station, headphones on, fingers moving through data I can't see from here. Three years we've been doing this—working the same contracts sometimes, splitting the fee, pretending the competition doesn't make us better. Worse. Something.

I touch her shoulder. She doesn't startle; she knew I was there. She always knows.

"The Martinez job came through," I say. "High-value add-ons. Could shave six months off my timeline."

She pulls one headphone back. "Good." But her eyes stay on her screen. "You should take it."

What she doesn't say: *while you still can.* What she doesn't say: *before the next price increase.* What she doesn't say: *before we run out of time to be people who have this conversation.*

I take my hand back. Get to work.

### Discovery Register (First Anomaly)

The protocol shouldn't exist.

I run the analysis three times. Check the source metadata. Cross-reference against every database I have access to—and a few I don't. The results stay the same.

The code is optimized for integration pathways that don't exist yet. It references compression methods I invented but haven't published. It knows shortcuts I developed last month, refined through iterations I haven't performed.

My hands are shaking. I put them flat on the desk. The surface is cool, smooth, real. I focus on the pressure of my palms against the polymer. Ground myself in what I know: this room, this desk, these files that shouldn't be here.

Someone built this using my methods. My signature is in every line.

But the timestamp predates my career by fifteen years.

### Intensity Register (Phantasm Encounter)

The visualization blooms in the projection field, and I forget to breathe.

It's not a glitch. I've seen glitches. This is—

The shape defies the mapping algorithm. A torus that isn't a torus. Curves that approach each other without meeting, spiraling into a center that keeps receding. I try to focus on one edge and find myself somewhere else in the structure. My eyes water. My bones hum.

I've been tracing this shape on the desk with my finger. I don't remember starting.

The frequency comes from nowhere—from inside my chest, from the server's vibration, from the shape itself. It's not sound. It's pressure, resonance, something that makes my teeth ache.

I should close the file. Run diagnostics. Report the anomaly.

Instead I lean closer. Let the geometry fill my vision. Feel the frequency settle into the spaces between my heartbeats.

I know this shape. I've always known this shape. I just couldn't see it until now.

## Forbidden Patterns

### From Algorithm Voice
- ❌ Nested conditional clauses ("if this, then perhaps...")
- ❌ Self-referential processing language ("I calculate," "I determine")
- ❌ Probabilistic hedging ("67% likelihood")
- ❌ Parallel syntactic structures listing options
- ❌ Present-tense philosophical questioning

### From Last Human Voice
- ❌ Sentence fragments (intentional incomplete sentences)
- ❌ Elegiac tone or mourning register
- ❌ Past-inflected present ("what was once")
- ❌ Silence/absence as primary texture
- ❌ Extreme sparseness

## Diagnostic Passages

Use these to recalibrate if voice drifts:

### Correct
> I plug the drive in and wait for the spin-up sound. The data starts loading. I watch the progress bar and think about what I'll find inside: someone's life, compressed into formats I can read.

### Incorrect (Algorithm contamination)
> ~~If the drive contains recoverable data, then I will proceed with extraction protocols. The probability of meaningful content approaches certainty, given the source parameters.~~

### Incorrect (Last Human contamination)
> ~~The drive. Waiting. I remember other drives, other waits. All of them leading to this, perhaps. Or away from it.~~

## Writing Exercises

1. **Describe receiving a new client contract.** Focus on the economic stakes, the physical act of reviewing files, the weight of responsibility.

2. **Describe a moment with Lena where neither speaks.** Use physical detail and spatial awareness to convey emotional content.

3. **Describe the first time the geometric form appears in data.** Ground the supernatural in the tactile—the desk, the humming servers, the ache in your eyes.
