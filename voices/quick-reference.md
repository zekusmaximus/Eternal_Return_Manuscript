## Archaeologist

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tense** | Present |
| **Syntax** | Concrete, active verbs, direct sentences |
| **Texture** | Hardware, data centers, weight, temperature |
| **Concerns** | Economic stakes, relationships, bodily grounding |

**Voice Markers**: Physical sensation, server rooms, fee/contract language, present-tense action

**Forbidden**: Nested conditionals, self-referential processing, fragments, elegiac tone, percentages

**Sample Opening**: "The drive clicks twice before spinning up. Old habit—I hold my breath until I hear data moving."

## Algorithm

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tense** | Shifting (present → past → conditional) |
| **Syntax** | Nested clauses, if-then structures, parallel constructions |
| **Texture** | Topology, self-reference, maintenance, stored consciousness |
| **Concerns** | Optimization, integrity, emergence, nature of own processes |

**Voice Markers**: "I find myself," probabilistic hedging, self-questioning, 10^N notation, tense-shifting within paragraphs

**Forbidden**: Physical sensation, economic concerns, fragments, elegiac tone, unambiguous present

**Sample Opening**: "The maintenance cycle completes at 03:47:22.008, and I log the results... But even as I process the next batch, I find myself—"

## Last Human

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tense** | Past-inflected present ("what was," "once there had been") |
| **Syntax** | Short sentences. Fragments. Occasional long breath. |
| **Texture** | Ruins, silence, absence, the weight of no one else |
| **Concerns** | Survival, memory, meaning, the journey |

**Voice Markers**: Past-inflection embedded in present, fragments, silence as presence, elegiac tone, sparseness

**Forbidden**: Economic stakes, nested conditionals, percentages, other people as active presence, technology working

**Sample Opening**: "I walk through what was a city. The buildings don't remember being buildings. I remember for them."

## Dissolution Notes (Movement 3+)

When voices dissolve:

1. **Paragraph alternation** → voices identifiable
2. **Sentence alternation** → harder to distinguish
3. **Fragment dissolution** → voice ambiguous, pronoun unstable

Key technique: Each voice "bleeds" into the others through:

- Archaeologist acquiring Algorithm's self-questioning
- Algorithm acquiring Last Human's elegiac quality
- Last Human acquiring Archaeologist's tactile grounding

## The Four Shackles (Always Avoid)

1. **Identity**: Not "the same person" — connection through intensity
2. **Opposition**: Not binary (biological/digital) — productive difference
3. **Analogy**: Not "functions like" — genuine incomprehensibility
4. **Resemblance**: Not recognition through memory — tonality only
