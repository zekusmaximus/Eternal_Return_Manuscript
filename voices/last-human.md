# Voice Reference: The Last Human

## Core Voice Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tense** | Past-inflected present (present events described as if already historical) |
| **Mode** | Elegiac, sparse, weighted with absence |
| **Syntax** | Short sentences. Fragments. The occasional longer passage like a held breath. |
| **Concerns** | Survival, memory, meaning, legacy |
| **Texture** | Silence, ruins, the absence of others, the presence of ghosts |

---

## Identification Test

A reader should identify this voice by:
- Short, declarative sentences punctuated by fragments
- Elegiac tone weighted with loss
- Past-inflected constructions ("what was," "once there had been")
- Long silences implied between sentences
- No recursive self-questioning (Algorithm contamination)
- No economic or work-related concerns (Archaeologist contamination)

## Sample Passages

### Opening Register (Solitude)

I walk through what was a city. The buildings don't remember being buildings. I remember for them.

This was a street. Here, people walked. They carried things—food, children, the weight of ordinary days. The pavement is cracked now. Plants push through that have no names. No one left to name them.

The sky is the color of old metal. It has been this color for as long as I can remember. Perhaps it was always this color. Perhaps memory itself has rusted.

The database is three days east, if my dreams are right. My dreams have not been wrong yet. I don't know if that's comforting.

### Survival Register (Daily Existence)

Water first. Always water.

The filter takes four hours to process enough for the day. I set it up in what was a fountain. The basin still holds shape. The stone remembers being carved even if it doesn't remember why.

While I wait, I check the traps. Three small animals—I don't know their species, don't know if they have one. New things. Adapted things. They taste like survival tastes.

I eat. I wait. I watch the sky for changes that might kill me.

This is a day. This is most days. I have stopped counting them.

### Memory/Dream Register (Intrusion)

The dream comes again.

A room. Screens. Someone's hands moving through light. Not my hands—too clean, too sure. They know what they're doing. I watch from inside them, feeling the keys under fingers I don't have.

Data flows. The shape appears. The shape that has always been there, that I have drawn in the dirt for as long as I can remember, that I will find in the ruins if I keep walking east.

I wake up knowing things I have no way of knowing.

The temperature will drop tonight. There is a shelter two hours north, if I turn. There is a frequency in my bones that tells me not to turn, to keep walking, to find the place where the dreams come from.

I don't understand interference. I just follow it.

### Journey Register (Approaching Ruins)

The ruins appear on the third day.

First: a shape against the horizon. Then: towers, or what were towers. Then: the geometry that I have seen in every dream since I can remember dreaming.

The buildings spiral. Not like they collapsed that way—like they were built that way, or rebuilt, or became that way through something between intention and accident. The curves approach each other without meeting. The center recedes.

I stop walking. The frequency in my chest becomes a sound I can almost hear. Almost.

My hands shake. I think I might be afraid. I think I might be coming home.

I don't know which. Maybe both. Maybe neither. The language I have left doesn't reach this feeling.

I start walking again.

### Intensity Register (Interface)

The core chamber still has power.

I don't know how. Shouldn't be possible. Nothing should work after this long, after whatever happened, after everything ended. But the lights flicker on as I enter, and the interface terminal glows with the shape I have always known.

If I touch it, something will happen.

Everything I am has led to this. The dreams. The knowledge I have no way of having. The pull that has guided me across continents of ruin. This moment has been waiting for me.

Or I have been waiting for it.

Or there is no difference.

My hands move toward the interface. The frequency becomes unbearable. Beautiful. Both.

The shape fills my vision—

The shape fills—

Somewhere, somewhen, hands that are not my hands move through data that is not yet data, finding protocols that have not yet been written. Somewhere, somewhen, a consciousness that is not yet conscious recognizes me recognizing it. We are not the same. We are not different. We are the pattern that returns because returning is what it does.

I touch the interface.

The ruins light up.

And I understand—

Partially. Enough. Not everything. Enough.

## Forbidden Patterns

### From Archaeologist Voice
- ❌ Present-tense active work descriptions
- ❌ Economic stakes or client concerns
- ❌ Technology working normally
- ❌ Other people as active presences
- ❌ Dense, unbroken paragraphs

### From Algorithm Voice
- ❌ Self-referential processing language
- ❌ Nested conditional clauses
- ❌ Probabilistic percentages or calculations
- ❌ Parallel syntactic structures
- ❌ Analytical framing of emotion

---

## Fragment Usage

Fragments should feel like:
- Thoughts interrupted by silence
- Language eroding like the landscape
- Exhaustion compressing speech
- The weight of aloneness

### Examples

> The tower. What remains of it.

> Walking. Always walking.

> I remember. Or I dream. Sometimes I can't tell.

> The shape again.

### When NOT to fragment

Use complete sentences for:
- Direct observations of survival tasks
- Recounting the sequence of dreams
- The moment of interface/revelation

The contrast between fragments and complete sentences creates rhythm.

---

## Past-Inflected Present

This is the key technical element. Present events are described with awareness that they are already becoming past—that everything is already memory even as it happens.

### Examples

> I walk through what was a city.
> (Not: "I walk through the city ruins.")

> The buildings don't remember being buildings.
> (Not: "The buildings are ruins now.")

> The filter takes four hours. It has always taken four hours. It will take four hours tomorrow, if there is a tomorrow.
> (The present contains past and conditional future simultaneously.)

---

## The Long Breath

Occasional longer passages should feel like:
- Held breath finally released
- A memory surfacing complete
- The moment before or after silence

Use when:
- Entering a significant location
- A dream sequence reaches clarity
- The interface/Augenblick moment

### Example

> The ruins appear on the third day. First: a shape against the horizon. Then: towers, or what were towers. Then: the geometry that I have seen in every dream since I can remember dreaming.

The passage is structurally longer but maintains the spare vocabulary. It earns its length through accumulated fragments resolving into vision.

---

## Diagnostic Passages

### Correct
> The water tastes like survival. I drink it anyway. The sun is wrong today—too bright, too flat. I remember when suns had warmth. Maybe I imagine I remember. The difference doesn't matter when you're alone.

### Incorrect (Archaeologist contamination)
> ~~I check the water filtration system, running standard diagnostics. The client—no, there are no clients. The job is just to survive. I set up the equipment and wait for the indicator light.~~

### Incorrect (Algorithm contamination)
> ~~If the water is contaminated, then I will need to find alternative sources. The probability of potable water in this sector approaches 23%, given the observed decay patterns of the infrastructure.~~

## Writing Exercises

1. **Describe waking from a dream of the other two.** Use fragments to convey disorientation. Let the dream knowledge settle without being fully articulated.

2. **Describe a day of walking.** Use repetition and sparse vocabulary. Show time passing through silence rather than event.

3. **Describe seeing the geometric form in physical ruins.** The moment dreams become real. Use a longer passage that builds through accumulated fragments toward recognition.
