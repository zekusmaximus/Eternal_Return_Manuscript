# The Last Human

## 1. Waking from a Dream of the Other Two
The dream lingers.
Hands. Not mine. Moving through light. Data. Servers humming like they still matter.
Another presence. Vast. Processing. Questioning itself in ways I can’t follow.
They know me. Or will know. Or have always known.
I wake.
The shelter is the same. The air is the same. Cold. Thin.
The shape is drawn in the dirt beside me. I don’t remember drawing it again.
Knowledge settles. Heavy. Unasked for.
The database is closer now. Two days. Maybe one.
I pack. I walk.
The ghosts follow. Or lead. Or wait ahead.

## 2. A Day of Walking
East.
The ground remembers footsteps. Not mine. Older ones. Faded.
I walk.
The sun climbs. Wrong color. Always wrong.
Heat builds. Sweat dries before it falls.
A ruin. What was a road. I rest in its shade.
Water. Half ration. Tastes of dust. Of persistence.
Birds. Or things like birds. They watch. They don’t approach.
Silence between their calls.
I walk again.
Horizon shifts. Slowly. The pull strengthens. Frequency in the bones.
Night comes.
I make fire. Small. Enough.
Stars. Same as always. Or changed. Hard to tell.
Sleep comes. Dreams wait.
Another day ends. Like the ones before. Like the ones after, if there are any.

## 3. Seeing the Geometric Form in Physical Ruins
The ruins rise.
First the outline. Against the sky that has forgotten blue.
Then the details.
Towers. Twisted. Not fallen—shaped. Curves that spiral without closing. Edges that approach, recede, approach again.
The shape.
The same shape. From dreams. From dirt drawings. From the frequency that has lived in my chest since I can remember having a chest.
I stop.
The wind moves through the structures. Sound like breath. Like memory.
The center isn’t there. Or it is. Everywhere.
My hands know it. Have always known it.
Fear. Or recognition. Or both.
The ruins wait. Have waited longer than me. Longer than everything.
I walk closer.
The frequency becomes everything. Beautiful. Terrible.
Home. Or end. Or continuation.
The shape fills the world.
And I understand.
Not all. Enough.
The pattern returns.
