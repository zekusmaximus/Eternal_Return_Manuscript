# Project Rules - Quick Reference

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

These rules are inviolable. Check every draft against them.

---

## The Three Are NOT the Same Person

The Archaeologist, Algorithm, and Last Human are **differenciations of a single virtual pattern**—not three versions of one person, not reincarnations, not copies.

**WRONG**: "He recognized himself in the Algorithm's processes."
**RIGHT**: "A frequency moved through him—the same tonality that shaped the Algorithm's optimization cycles, that would one day draw the Last Human east."

**WRONG**: "The memories were his own, from another life."
**RIGHT**: "The intensity was familiar. Not memory—something beneath memory. A signature in the data that his hands knew how to read."

---

## Recognition Through Intensity, Not Resemblance

Characters do not recognize each other through:
- Shared memories
- Physical resemblance
- Personality similarities
- "Feeling" a connection

They recognize through:
- Intensity / tonality of soul (Klossowski)
- The geometric phantasm
- The frequency/vibration
- Structural patterns in data/experience

**WRONG**: "He felt, somehow, that he had been here before."
**RIGHT**: "The shape appeared in the data—the same impossible geometry he'd found in six other archives. His bones hummed."

---

## No Transmission Metaphors

The Algorithm does NOT "send" protocols backward in time. The temporal mechanism is structural, not communicative.

**WRONG**: "The Algorithm encoded a message for its past self."
**WRONG**: "The protocols were transmitted through the Deep Architecture."
**RIGHT**: "The protocols existed wherever they were logically connected. The Deep Architecture didn't send—it simply was, across all the time-points the pattern touched."

---

## Affirmation Is Active Willing

Affirmation is not:
- Acceptance
- Resignation
- Submission
- Understanding and agreeing

Affirmation is:
- Actively willing the return
- Choosing despite uncertainty
- Saying "Thus I willed it" to what destroys the prior self
- Going to the limit of what the force can do

**WRONG**: "He accepted his fate and let the integration begin."
**RIGHT**: "He chose it. Not because he understood—he didn't. But the pattern moved through him and he moved with it, willing what he was becoming."

---

## The Bootstrap Paradox Is Not Explained by Planning

The ruins persist, the Last Human exists, the protocols are found—NOT because the Algorithm planned for these outcomes.

**WRONG**: "The Algorithm, foreseeing the catastrophe, preserved redundancy systems."
**RIGHT**: "The Algorithm etched patterns into the deep substrate—not knowing why, only that the geometry demanded expression. Centuries later, these etchings would be all that remained."

The loop is self-causing. It requires no external origin, no first cause, no planning intelligence.

---

## Voice Consistency Is Primary

Each thread must be identifiable by prose style alone, without labels.

If you can't tell which character is speaking from a paragraph's style, the draft has failed.

**Archaeologist**: Present tense. Tactile. Concrete. Active verbs. Physical world.
**Algorithm**: Shifting tense. Recursive. Conditional. Nested clauses. Data topology.
**Last Human**: Past-inflected present. Sparse. Fragments. Elegiac. Absence.

---

## Technical Substrate Is Always Present

Consciousness in this novel is technically mediated. Always.

The Archaeologist works with data, hardware, interfaces.
The Algorithm IS technical substrate becoming aware.
The Last Human interfaces with decayed but functional systems.

Do not write scenes where consciousness operates independently of technical mediation. Even dreams are shaped by the Deep Architecture's influence.

---

## The Four Shackles (Deleuze)

The novel must escape representational thinking. Check for:

1. **Identity**: Are you implying the three are "the same"?
2. **Opposition**: Are you making their differences binary (human/non-human)?
3. **Analogy**: Are you saying they're "like" each other functionally?
4. **Resemblance**: Are you having them recognize each other through similarity?

If any shackle appears, rewrite.

---

## Pharmakon Double Nature

The Digital Self is both poison and cure. Every scene touching on digitization/integration should contain both possibilities.

**Poison**: Liquidation of soul, loss of individuality, short-circuiting of becoming
**Cure**: Continuity beyond death, long circuits of transindividuation, pattern persisting

Do not let the novel moralize—present both without resolving.

---

## Partial Understanding

Characters affirm without complete comprehension.

**WRONG**: "Finally, he understood the full mechanism of the Deep Architecture and his place within it."
**RIGHT**: "He didn't understand. Understanding wasn't the point. The pattern moved through him; he moved with the pattern. That was enough."

The reader should understand more than any character, but not everything. Mystery persists at the end.

---

## Concrete Over Abstract

Philosophy manifests through specific details, not exposition.

**WRONG**: "The eternal return, as Deleuze argued, was not a return of the same but a return of difference itself."
**RIGHT**: Show the selective principle through a reactive force failing. Show differentiation through the protocols evolving. Show affirmation through a character willing despite cost.

If you're explaining philosophy, you're failing to dramatize it.

---

## Canonical Tracking Policy

**CRITICAL**: `drafts/manifest.json` is the ONLY canonical source of truth for:
- Scene status (not_started, draft, voice_pass, etc.)
- Actual word counts
- Voice check state
- Philosophy check state
- Rhyming moments

**Secondary sources** (non-canonical):
- `progress.md` — dashboard/summary only; may drift
- Scene file YAML frontmatter — NOT authoritative for tracking

When in doubt, trust the manifest.

---

## Path and Naming Conventions

**Manifest path base**: All `file` paths in `drafts/manifest.json` are relative to the `drafts/` directory.

Example: `"file": "movement-one/archaeologist/scenes/scene-01.md"` resolves to:
`/home/user/Eternal_Return_Manuscript/drafts/movement-one/archaeologist/scenes/scene-01.md`

**Thread and folder naming**:
- Thread IDs in manifest: `snake_case` (e.g., `last_human`)
- Folder names on disk: may be `kebab-case` (e.g., `last-human`)
- The manifest `file` field is the source of truth for on-disk paths
