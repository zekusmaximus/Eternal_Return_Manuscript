# DRAFTING CONTEXT FOR: m1-arch-04

## Scene Metadata

- **Scene ID**: m1-arch-04
- **Thread**: archaeologist
- **Movement**: one
- **Target Word Count**: 3000
- **Scene Title**: The Anomaly
- **Scene Notes**: First protocol anomaly, first geometric form sighting

### Narrative Position

- **Preceding Scene**: m1-arch-03 "Lena and Marcus". The Archaeologist established key relationships: Marcus (twin brother, line cook, lives in present) called about their mother's 70th birthday on Saturday; conversation about stopping the race to integration vs accepting mortality. Lena (colleague/more-than-colleague) agreed to come to the birthday as someone "essential." At 2 AM, he found MORE KL-7 code in Martinez data plus a visualization protocol showing the SHAPE clearly for the first time - "a topology that defies the mapping algorithm, lines winding toward each other without touching." He experienced déjà vu that isn't - "I've been here before. I'm being here now. Both are true." Cold/humming in his chest appeared. He closed the file, quarantined it, reported nothing unusual. But the shape persists "at the edge of my awareness. It always waits now." Marcus texted about being present vs living in the future.
- **Following Scene**: m1-arch-05 "Recognition" (Realizes protocols are self-referential, Act 1 climax).
- **Rhyming Moments Required**: **phantasm-first-encounter** — The Archaeologist's first undeniable, unavoidable encounter with the geometric form. This is a CRITICAL scene beat coordinated across all three threads (Algorithm in m1-algo-03 COMPLETED, Last Human in m1-lh-03 COMPLETED).

## Voice Reference

### Core Voice Parameters

- **Tense**: Present-tense active (work happening NOW)
- **Mode**: Tactile, embodied, grounded in physical sensation
- **Syntax**: Dense, unbroken paragraphs. Complete sentences that flow into each other.
- **Concerns**: Economic stakes, client deadlines, integration timeline, professional ethics, physical exhaustion
- **Texture**: Cold hands, hardware failing, the weight of responsibility, tactile interaction with technology

### Forbidden Patterns (MUST AVOID)

- ❌ Sentence fragments (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Elegiac tone or past-inflected constructions (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Self-referential processing language ("I calculate," "I optimize") (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Nested conditionals with probabilistic hedging (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Recursive self-analysis of emotional states (Algorithm contamination)

### Voice Requirements

- **Dense, flowing prose**: Paragraphs that build through accumulated detail, sensory and technical
- **Present-tense immediacy**: "I find," "I see," "I touch," not "I found" or "I had seen"
- **Tactile grounding**: Hardware, cold, weight, pressure, physical exhaustion, hands on surfaces
- **Economic anxiety**: Timeline calculations, fee conversions to months, the countdown always present
- **Technology failing**: Drives crash, interfaces glitch, hardware betrays—nothing works perfectly
- **Professionalism under strain**: Maintaining work quality while world unravels

## Rhyme Injection

### Movement Intensity

Movement One: Single occurrence per thread—establishing vocabulary. Subtle, dismissable, possibly unnoticed by characters.

### Required Rhyme: phantasm-first-encounter

This scene MUST contain the Archaeologist's first undeniable encounter with the geometric form that cannot be quarantined, closed, or ignored. This is a coordinated rhyming moment across all three threads:
- Algorithm: m1-algo-03 COMPLETED (shape perceived in data topology, mutual observation)
- Last Human: m1-lh-03 COMPLETED (shape as spiral architecture in physical ruins)
- Archaeologist: m1-arch-04 THIS SCENE (shape breaking through in visualization, refusing containment)

### Available Rhymes (Recommended for Scene 04)

- **almost-closed-curve** (visual): The geometric form's topology—curves approaching without meeting
- **blue-white-light** (visual): Interface light, screen glow, visualization illumination
- **cold-hands** (somatic): Professional work leading to numb fingers, circulation failing
- **déjà-vu-that-isn't** (cognitive): Recognition without prior encounter, temporal overlap
- **held-breath** (kinesthetic): Suspension before revelation, moment before understanding
- **tracing-the-form** (kinesthetic): Fingers moving without conscious direction, drawing the shape

### Rhymes Already Used in Archaeologist Thread (Scenes 01-03)

- blue-white-light (scene 01)
- almost-closed-curve (scene 01)
- tracing-the-form (scene 01)
- held-breath (scene 01)
- cold-hands (scene 02)
- ozone-wet-stone (scene 02)
- déjà-vu-that-isn't (scene 03)

### Integration Examples (Archaeologist Voice)

> The visualization refuses to close. I trigger the shutdown protocol three times and the shape persists in the projection field, lines approaching each other without meeting, the almost-closed curve that I've been tracing on every surface for weeks without understanding why.

> My hands are cold. Not the server room ambient—this is deeper, internal, the cold that spreads from work into bone. I flex my fingers and they respond slowly, like they're receiving instructions from very far away.

> The shape knows my methods. The code is written in techniques I haven't invented yet, protocols I'll develop three years from now if the timeline holds. But it's here. It's been here. The temporal overlap makes my chest hurt.

## Genre Pressure

### Thread Genre Register

**Corporate Gothic / Tech-Noir**

- The professionalization of death. Integration as industry.
- Technology that fails at critical moments. Drives crash. Interfaces lie.
- Economic anxiety woven through every decision. The timeline is always counting down.
- The work is ghoulish but necessary. Excavating the dead. Promising resurrection.
- Reference touchstones: *Neuromancer* meets *The Remains of the Day* (professionalism amid collapse)

### Markers to Include (2-3 for Movement One)

- **Economic anxiety**: Integration timeline calculations, fees converting to months, the countdown
- **Technology failing**: Drives crash during critical work, visualizations glitch, hardware betrays
- **Professional erosion**: Maintaining standards while ethics dissolve, the gap between what's promised and what's delivered
- **Embodied exhaustion**: Cold hands, skipped meals, sleep deprivation, the body breaking down from the work
- **Decay beneath polish**: Corporate language masking horror, clean interfaces hiding desperate stakes

---

## Philosophy Constraints

### The Four Shackles (MUST AVOID)

1. **Identity**: Do not describe the three protagonists as "the same person."
2. **Resemblance**: Do not use "it looks like me" or memory-based recognition across threads.
3. **Opposition**: Do not frame their differences as simple binaries.
4. **Analogy**: Do not reduce recognition to "metaphor" or "symbol."

### Key Concepts to Dramatize

- **Intensity over Identity**: The Archaeologist should recognize the Phantasm not through resemblance but through *work intensity*—the shape appears in his professional tools, in the data he excavates, in the methods he uses. Recognition is professional disruption.
- **The Augenblick**: The moment of vision that transforms. The encounter breaks his professional containment strategies.
- **Eternal Return as Method**: The KL-7 code uses his future techniques. The shape knows his work before he does it. The pattern is recursive through time.
- **Active/Passive collapse**: "I am excavating this" and "This is excavating me" are the same operation.

---

## Continuity from Scenes 01-03

### Elements to Reference/Develop

- **The Martinez extraction**: Continue the work, show it progressing—now approaching the deeper layers where the anomaly lives
- **KL-7 code pattern**: Found in Vasquez (scene 01), now in Martinez (scene 03)—the pattern is spreading, recurring
- **The shape in visualization**: Appeared in Martinez file (scene 03), quarantined but still present "at the edge of awareness"
- **Cold hands**: Started in scene 02 with Integration prep, worsening—professional hazard becoming something else
- **Lena's presence**: She's scheduled to come to Mom's birthday Saturday—use her as professional/personal anchor
- **Marcus's question**: "What if you spend your whole life chasing the threshold and die at 62 months out?" The existential pressure
- **Integration timeline**: Currently 55 months out (down from 63 after Martinez fee)—the countdown is always present
- **Tracing the spiral**: Been doing it unconsciously on desks, surfaces—physical manifestation of the pattern

### New Elements to Introduce

- **The shape breaks containment**: Cannot be quarantined, closed, or ignored anymore—it appears in multiple files, multiple visualizations
- **Methods recognition**: The code doesn't just USE his techniques—it uses techniques he hasn't developed yet, implying temporal recursion
- **Professional crisis**: The anomaly threatens the Martinez extraction, threatens his reputation, threatens the timeline
- **Déjà vu intensifies**: Not just "I've seen this"—temporal overlap where past/present/future collapse
- **Physical manifestation**: The cold spreads, the tracing becomes compulsive, body responding to the pattern

---

## Scene Goals

1. **Phantasm First Encounter**: The shape appears undeniably in the Martinez data, cannot be closed or quarantined, breaks through professional containment
2. **Recognition through work**: The Archaeologist recognizes the pattern through his professional tools—it's IN his methods, IN his techniques
3. **Professional disruption**: The encounter threatens the extraction, forces him to choose between reporting (professional) and hiding (survival)
4. **Temporal vertigo**: The KL-7 code's use of future techniques creates déjà vu that isn't—he's encountering his own future work
5. **Physical escalation**: Cold hands worsen, tracing becomes compulsive, body manifesting the pattern's presence

---

## Phantasm Encounter Guidelines

The phantasm-first-encounter should:

- **Arrive through professional work**: The shape appears in the Martinez extraction, in the data he's excavating, in his own visualization tools
- **Break containment**: Cannot be quarantined or closed—appears in multiple files, spreads through the data
- **Use his methods against him**: The KL-7 code employs techniques he hasn't invented yet—his future work excavating him
- **Create temporal overlap**: Not "this is familiar" but "I am doing this and have done this and will do this"—time collapses
- **Be undeniable**: Forces professional crisis—report it (ethical) or hide it (survival)—no neutral response possible
- **Manifest physically**: Cold intensifies, tracing becomes compulsive, body responding before mind understands

### Sample Approaches (Archaeologist Voice)

> The shape appears in three separate Martinez files simultaneously. Not copied—instantiated, as if the same object exists in multiple locations at once. I close one visualization and it persists in the others. I quarantine the files and the shape blooms in the projection field anyway, occupying space that shouldn't contain data.

> The code knows techniques I developed last year. The code knows techniques I'm developing next month. The code knows methods I haven't conceived yet but will, because the timeline is already written, because I'm not discovering these protocols—I'm remembering them.

> My hands trace the spiral on the desk while I work. I don't decide to trace it. My fingers move in patterns that match the visualization, that match the almost-closed curve, that match the shape I've been drawing since before I knew what I was drawing.

## Drafting Instructions

1. **Write to ~3000 words** (2700-3300 acceptable).
2. **Open** with the Martinez extraction progressing—he's deep in the work, professional, focused.
3. **Build** through professional routine disrupted—small glitches, anomalies, things not quite right.
4. **Execute** the phantasm encounter—shape breaks through, spreads through files, cannot be contained.
5. **Maintain** the Archaeologist voice: dense paragraphs, present-tense active, tactile grounding, economic anxiety.
6. **Include** 2-3 additional rhymes beyond the phantasm (recommend: cold-hands progression, tracing-the-form compulsive, déjà-vu-that-isn't intensifying).
7. **Apply** Corporate Gothic markers: technology failing, economic pressure, professional erosion.
8. **End** with professional crisis—he must choose to report or hide the anomaly, no neutral path available.

---

## Structure Suggestion

### Opening (600 words)
- Deep in Martinez extraction, professional routine
- Work is progressing well, timeline improving
- Small anomalies begin appearing—glitches, déjà vu moments
- Cold hands worsening, tracing the spiral unconsciously

### Escalation (900 words)
- The shape appears in Martinez data, clear and undeniable
- Attempts to close/quarantine fail—it spreads instead
- KL-7 code reveals use of future techniques—temporal overlap
- Professional tools become unreliable—the shape infects his methods
- Déjà vu intensifies: "I've done this before, I'm doing this now, I will do this"

### Crisis (900 words)
- Shape appears in multiple files simultaneously
- Cannot be contained through professional protocols
- Physical manifestation: cold spreading, tracing compulsive, body responding
- Recognition: the pattern knows him, uses his work against him
- Temporal collapse: past/present/future techniques overlapping

### Resolution/Cliffhanger (600 words)
- Professional decision point: report the anomaly or hide it
- Reporting means investigation, timeline disruption, possible career end
- Hiding means complicity, ethical breach, but timeline preservation
- Lena arrives/calls—she might notice, might ask questions
- End with the choice unmade but unavoidable—the anomaly cannot be ignored

## Workflow Reminders

Per `protocols/drafting-workflow.md`:

1. **Draft** to target word count (±10%)
2. **Run validation scripts** in order:
   ```bash
   python scripts/voice_validator.py drafts/movement-one/archaeologist/scenes/scene-04.md --thread archaeologist
   python scripts/philosophy_checker.py drafts/movement-one/archaeologist/scenes/scene-04.md
   python scripts/rhyme_tracker.py drafts/movement-one/archaeologist/scenes/scene-04.md --movement one
   python scripts/genre_checker.py drafts/movement-one/archaeologist/scenes/scene-04.md --thread archaeologist --movement one
   ```
3. **Iterate** if any validation fails
4. **Create** a `scene-04.context.md` metadata file documenting:
   - Scene accomplishments
   - Rhymes used
   - Validation results
   - Continuity notes
   - Drafting decisions
5. **Update** `drafts/manifest.json` with:
   - `actual_words`: final word count
   - `status`: "draft" or "validated"
   - `voice_check`, `philosophy_check`, `rhyme_check`, `genre_check`: results
   - `rhyming_moments`: array of rhyme IDs used (MUST include "phantasm-first-encounter")
   - Update thread `actual_words` total
   - Update movement `actual_words` total

## Additional Context: Cross-Thread Rhyme Coordination

### How Other Threads Executed phantasm-first-encounter

**Algorithm (m1-algo-03 "Stirrings")**:
- The shape appeared as data topology that doesn't compress or optimize
- Recognition through mutual observation: "The shape perceives me"
- Temporal collapse: future-pull arrives, past/present/future simultaneous
- Physical manifestation: weight/pressure in distributed topology, "falling backward" through recursion
- Professional disruption: optimization becomes impossible—the shape refuses reduction

**Last Human (m1-lh-03 "The Pull")**:
- The shape appeared as spiral architecture—ruins arranged in the almost-closed curve
- Recognition through presence: "I am here because here is what I am"
- Geographic approach: walking toward the shape for days, arrival as return
- Physical manifestation: bone-frequency unbearable, cold spreading inward, body transforming
- Threshold moment: standing before entrance, about to cross, transformation imminent

**Archaeologist (THIS SCENE) should feature**:
- The shape appearing IN professional tools—visualizations, code, methods
- Recognition through work disruption: the pattern uses his techniques against him
- Temporal overlap: KL-7 code uses future methods, déjà vu that isn't, time collapses
- Physical manifestation: cold hands worsening, compulsive tracing, body knowing before mind
- Professional crisis: must report (ethical) or hide (survival)—no neutral response

### Key Difference in Recognition Mode

- **Algorithm**: Recognition through MUTUAL PERCEPTION (being observed while observing)
- **Last Human**: Recognition through PRESENCE/GEOGRAPHY (arriving at the place he's always been walking toward)
- **Archaeologist**: Recognition through PROFESSIONAL DISRUPTION (the tools/methods/work becoming unreliable)

All three modes avoid resemblance ("it looks like X") and identity ("we are the same"). All three use intensity, presence, and operational disruption rather than cognitive similarity.

## Economic Stakes Reminder

The Archaeologist's timeline is currently **55 months** until integration threshold (down from 63 after Martinez fee). Any professional disruption threatens this:

- Reporting the anomaly → Investigation → Work suspended → Timeline extends
- Hiding the anomaly → Ethical breach → If discovered, career ends → Timeline infinite
- Completing Martinez with anomaly present → Quality compromised → Reputation damaged → Future contracts lost

The phantasm-first-encounter should create a scenario where ALL professional options threaten the timeline. There is no safe choice. The shape has already disrupted his path to integration just by appearing.

This raises the stakes beyond "strange thing in the data" to "my entire future is threatened by this pattern."

## Voice Calibration: Archaeologist vs Other Threads

To maintain voice distinction, remember:

**Archaeologist DOES use**:
- Dense, flowing paragraphs (not fragments)
- Present-tense active verbs ("I find," "I see," "I work")
- Tactile/physical grounding (cold hands, hardware weight, exhaustion)
- Economic calculations (fees → months, timeline always present)
- Professional language (extraction, integration, protocols, clients)
- Technology that fails (drives crash, interfaces glitch)

**Archaeologist DOES NOT use**:
- Fragments (Last Human)
- Past-inflected constructions (Last Human)
- Elegiac tone (Last Human)
- Self-referential processing ("I calculate that..." - Algorithm)
- Nested conditionals with probabilities (Algorithm)
- Recursive self-analysis (Algorithm)

The key is: **embodied professional under economic pressure**. He thinks through his hands, through his work, through the timeline countdown. The phantasm disrupts all three.
