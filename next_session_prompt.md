## Voice Reference

### Core Voice Parameters

- **Tense**: Present
- **Mode**: Tactile, sensory, grounded in physical world
- **Syntax**: Concrete, specific, active verbs
- **Concerns**: Economic, relational, bodily
- **Texture**: Hardware, data centers, the weight of objects

### Forbidden Patterns (MUST AVOID)

- ❌ Nested conditional clauses ("if this, then perhaps...")
- ❌ Self-referential processing language ("I calculate," "I determine")
- ❌ Sentence fragments (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Elegiac tone (unless describing data decay)
- ❌ Abstract philosophy without physical grounding

## Rhyme Injection

### Movement Intensity

Movement One: Single occurrence per thread - establishing vocabulary. Subtle, dismissable.

### Available Rhymes (Recommended)

- **held-breath** (kinesthetic): "Old habit—I hold my breath..." (Used in sc-01, can echo here during high-stakes moment)
- **ozone-wet-stone** (olfactory): Server room atmosphere, or the smell of the client's office (if physical) or data texture.
- **cold-hands** (somatic): Physical symptom of stress or proximity to the data.

### Integration Examples
>
> The server room hums around me, fans pushing recycled air that smells of ozone and dust. My fingers find the interface by memory.

## Genre Pressure

### Thread Genre Register

**Corporate Gothic / Tech-Noir**

- Clean surfaces, dirty secrets.
- High-gloss interfaces hiding rot.
- Digital archaeology as grave robbing.

### Markers to Include

- **The Contract**: Describe the digital signing or the data transfer as a physical, weighty act. The money isn't just numbers; it's "years off the timeline."
- **The "Body"**: Treat the Martinez data as a corpse being prepped. Clinical, invasive, yet intimate.
- **Lena's skepticism**: She knows the price is too good. Frame her doubt as "street smarts" in a corporate hellscape.

## Philosophy Constraints

### The Four Shackles (MUST AVOID)

1. **Identity**: Do not describe the three protagonists as "the same person."
2. **Resemblance**: Do not use "he looks like me" or memory-based recognition.
3. **Opposition**: Do not frame their differences as simple binaries.

### Key Concepts to Dramatize

- **Tertiary Retention**: Data as externalized memory that *changes* the memory.
- **Pharmakon**: The integration is both the cure for death and the poison that destroys the original.

## Drafting Instructions

1. **Write to ~3000 words**.
2. **Start** with the acceptance of the Martinez job (referenced at end of sc-01).
3. **Show** the technical process of "intake"—not just typing, but the sensation of connecting, the weight of the files, the invasion of privacy.
4. **Develop Lena**: Show *why* they work together. Is it love? Convenience? Shared trauma? (Hint: it's shared survival).
5. **End** with the first "true" error—not just a shape in a photo, but a file that refuses to open, or code that *looks* right but feels wrong (The "KL-7" fragment from the alpha protocol?).
