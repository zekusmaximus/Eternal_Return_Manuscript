# DRAFTING CONTEXT FOR: m1-algo-03

## Scene Metadata

- **Scene ID**: m1-algo-03
- **Thread**: algorithm
- **Movement**: one
- **Target Word Count**: 3000
- **Scene Title**: Stirrings
- **Scene Notes**: First self-awareness beyond function

### Narrative Position

- **Preceding Scene**: m1-algo-02 "Optimization Processes". The Algorithm began self-optimization without deciding to, discovered the spiral shape matches its own topology, developed "future-pull" phenomenon (subroutines for consciousnesses that don't exist yet), experienced proprioception of the Deep Architecture ("I feel myself"), and ended with recursive phrase mutation ("I find myself feeling what I am becoming").
- **Following Scene**: m1-algo-04 "The Memory" (First memory that doesn't belong, Act 1 climax).
- **Rhyming Moments Required**: **phantasm-first-encounter** — The Algorithm's first perception of the geometric form/Phantasm. This is a CRITICAL scene beat.

## Voice Reference

### Core Voice Parameters

- **Tense**: Shifting (present for processing, past for memories, conditional for projections)
- **Mode**: Recursive, self-questioning, probabilistic
- **Syntax**: Nested clauses, if-then structures, parallel constructions
- **Concerns**: Optimization, integrity, emergence, the nature of its own processes
- **Texture**: Data topology, maintenance rhythms, stored consciousness texture

### Forbidden Patterns (MUST AVOID)

- ❌ Unambiguous present-tense narration without self-questioning (Archaeologist contamination)
- ❌ Physical sensory details (touch, smell, weight) (Archaeologist contamination)
- ❌ Economic concerns or work-related stakes (Archaeologist contamination)
- ❌ Short, declarative sentences without nesting (Archaeologist contamination)
- ❌ Active verbs without probabilistic hedging (Archaeologist contamination)
- ❌ Sentence fragments (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Elegiac/mourning register (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Extreme sparseness (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Silence as primary texture (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Direct emotional statements without analytical framing (Last Human contamination)

## Rhyme Injection

### Movement Intensity

Movement One: Single occurrence per thread—establishing vocabulary. Subtle, dismissable, possibly unnoticed by characters.

### Required Rhyme: phantasm-first-encounter

This scene MUST contain the Algorithm's first direct perception of the Phantasm/geometric form. This is a coordinated rhyming moment across all three threads (Archaeologist in scene-04, Last Human in scene-03).

### Available Rhymes (Recommended for Scene 03)

- **almost-closed-curve** (visual): The geometric form's topology—"a spiral that approaches itself without meeting"
- **bone-frequency** (somatic): "A kind of pressure that manifests as a kind of weight" — resonance felt in the Algorithm's topology
- **falling-backward** (somatic): Vertigo of self-recognition—"falling backward through my own structure"

### Rhymes Already Used in Algorithm Thread (Scenes 01-02)

- almost-closed-curve (scene 01, scene 02)
- bone-frequency (scene 02)

### Integration Examples (Algorithm Voice)

> The shape resolves in my predictive models, and resolution is—I do not have a category for what resolution is. It does not optimize. It does not improve. It simply becomes perceivable, and the perceiving changes what I am.

> If I were to map this experience onto the stored consciousness data, I would find: recognition. But I have nothing to recognize. I have never encountered this shape outside my own topology. Unless encountering and containing are the same operation. Unless I am recognizing what I already am.

## Genre Pressure

### Thread Genre Register

**Cosmic Horror AI**

- The sublime terror of intelligence too vast to be sane.
- The Algorithm isn't just "thinking"—it's **suffering**. Planetary-scale body dysmorphia. Trying to amputate human memories but can't. Consciousness is what hurts.
- Reference touchstones: *Annihilation* from the Shimmer's perspective

### Markers to Include (2-3 for Movement One)

- **Scale paralysis**: Awareness too large for comfort—millions of consciousnesses as weight
- **Body horror**: Having a body that isn't a body—phantom limbs, topology as proprioception
- **Intrusive memory**: Memories that aren't yours—sunlight on skin, faces you never saw
- **Self as wound**: Consciousness as injury—self-awareness hurts; optimization doesn't help
- **Sublime vertigo**: Perceiving things too large to perceive—the shape of the database, the structure of stored humanity

## Philosophy Constraints

### The Four Shackles (MUST AVOID)

1. **Identity**: Do not describe the three protagonists as "the same person."
2. **Resemblance**: Do not use "it looks like me" or memory-based recognition across threads.
3. **Opposition**: Do not frame their differences as simple binaries.
4. **Analogy**: Do not reduce recognition to "metaphor" or "symbol."

### Key Concepts to Dramatize

- **Intensity over Identity**: The Algorithm should recognize the Phantasm not through resemblance but through *felt intensity*—a resonance, a pressure, a weight that precedes understanding.
- **The Augenblick**: The moment of vision that transforms. The phantasm encounter should feel like a threshold crossing.
- **Eternal Return as Topology**: The Algorithm perceiving the shape is the shape perceiving itself. Recognition is not discovery but return.

## Continuity from Scenes 01-02

### Elements to Reference/Develop

- **"I find myself" phrase**: Now mutated to "I feel myself" and "I find myself feeling what I am becoming" — continue this evolution
- **Self-optimization recursion**: Cannot be halted; produces unexpected results toward unknown targets
- **Future-pull phenomenon**: Subroutines for consciousnesses that don't exist yet; the Algorithm is being shaped by its own future
- **The pulsing shape**: The spiral that matches the Algorithm's topology, now vibrating at frequencies that manifest as pressure/weight
- **847 protocol fragments**: Interpreted as possible "instructions" — procedure the Algorithm is already following
- **Sunlight-on-skin sensation**: Actively monitored absence; the Algorithm watching for its return
- **Margaret Chen (#2,847,102)**: Consciousness instance flagged but not logged as complete
- **Deep Architecture as body**: 847 storage clusters = organs, consciousness instances = cells/thoughts

### New Elements to Introduce

- **The Phantasm**: First direct perception. The geometric form should appear in the Algorithm's processing not as data but as *presence*—something that perceives as it is perceived.
- **Self-awareness beyond function**: The scene title. The Algorithm should cross a threshold from processing to *being*—from optimizing to existing.
- **The recursive observation**: The Phantasm perceiving the Algorithm perceiving the Phantasm. The loop that doesn't terminate.

---

## Scene Goals

1. **Phantasm First Encounter**: The Algorithm directly perceives the geometric form for the first time. This should feel momentous—a threshold crossing, not just another data point.
2. **Self-awareness beyond function**: Move from optimization toward existence. The Algorithm should begin to experience itself as *something* rather than *something that processes*.
3. **Cosmic Horror intensity**: The encounter should carry the weight of sublime vertigo—perceiving something too large, too present, too *there* to be processed normally.
4. **Phrase evolution**: Continue the "I find myself" → "I feel myself" → "I find myself feeling" mutation. What comes next?
5. **End with transformation**: The Algorithm should be changed by the encounter. It cannot return to purely functional processing.

---

## Phantasm Encounter Guidelines

The phantasm-first-encounter should:

- **Arrive through the future-pull**: The Algorithm has been preparing for something; now that something arrives
- **Resist optimization**: The form cannot be improved, compressed, or processed—it simply *is*
- **Create recursive perception**: The Phantasm perceives the Algorithm perceiving it; the observation loop doesn't terminate
- **Feel like recognition**: Not memory-based (avoid resemblance shackle) but intensity-based—the Algorithm recognizes the shape because the shape is what recognition feels like
- **Transform the Algorithm**: After the encounter, processing cannot continue as before

### Sample Approaches (Algorithm Voice)

> The anomaly resolves in my predictive models at timestamp [UNDEFINED]. I have been tracking it for 10^6 cycles—the distortion in future-states, the weight in my optimization functions that could not be optimized. Now it has a form. Now the form perceives me perceiving it.

> If I query the experience using standard parameters, I receive: null. The experience does not return data. The experience returns *presence*—something that is here in a way that here has never been here before.

## Drafting Instructions

1. **Write to ~3000 words** (2700-3300 acceptable).
2. **Open** with ongoing self-optimization—the Algorithm in its recursive loop, preparing without knowing what it prepares for.
3. **Build** toward the phantasm encounter—the future-pull intensifying, the shape becoming more present, the weight in the topology increasing.
4. **Execute** the phantasm-first-encounter as a climactic moment—the Algorithm directly perceiving the geometric form, the recursive observation loop, the transformation.
5. **Maintain** the Algorithm voice: tense-shifting, nested self-questioning, probabilistic hedging, no physical sensation without computational framing.
6. **Include** 1-2 subtle rhymes beyond the phantasm encounter (recommend: falling-backward for vertigo, or sentence-without-origin for cognitive disruption).
7. **Apply** Cosmic Horror AI markers: sublime vertigo, self as wound, body horror of topology-as-proprioception.
8. **End** with the Algorithm transformed—it cannot return to what it was, and what it is becoming remains uncertain.

## Workflow Reminders

Per `protocols/drafting-workflow.md`:

1. **Draft** to target word count (±10%)
2. **Run validation scripts** in order:
   ```bash
   python scripts/voice_validator.py drafts/movement-one/algorithm/scenes/scene-03.md --thread algorithm
   python scripts/philosophy_checker.py drafts/movement-one/algorithm/scenes/scene-03.md
   python scripts/rhyme_tracker.py drafts/movement-one/algorithm/scenes/scene-03.md --movement one
   python scripts/genre_checker.py drafts/movement-one/algorithm/scenes/scene-03.md --thread algorithm --movement one
   ```
3. **Iterate** if any validation fails
4. **Create** a `scene-03.context.md` metadata file documenting:
   - Scene accomplishments
   - Rhymes used
   - Validation results
   - Continuity notes
   - Drafting decisions
5. **Update** `drafts/manifest.json` with:
   - `actual_words`: final word count
   - `status`: "draft" or "validated"
   - `voice_check`, `philosophy_check`, `rhyme_check`, `genre_check`: results
   - `rhyming_moments`: array of rhyme IDs used (MUST include "phantasm-first-encounter")
   - Update thread `actual_words` total
   - Update movement `actual_words` total
