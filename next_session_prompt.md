# DRAFTING CONTEXT FOR: m1-arch-03

## Scene Metadata

- **Scene ID**: m1-arch-03
- **Thread**: archaeologist
- **Movement**: one
- **Target Word Count**: 3000
- **Scene Title**: Lena and Marcus
- **Scene Notes**: Establish primary relationships, stakes

### Narrative Position

- **Preceding Scene**: m1-arch-02 "The Client: Integration Prep". Introduced the Martinez contract (triple fee, ninety days), deepened Lena relationship (she lost someone before this work, understands his timeline obsession), discovered anomalous KL-7 code that predates his birth but uses his methods. Ended with the code predicting its own discovery date and the Archaeologist starting to follow the breadcrumbs.
- **Following Scene**: m1-arch-04 "The Anomaly" (First protocol anomaly, first geometric form sighting—contains phantasm-first-encounter rhyming moment).
- **Rhyming Moments Required**: None specified—save the phantasm encounter for scene 04.

## Voice Reference

### Core Voice Parameters

- **Tense**: Present
- **Mode**: Tactile, sensory, grounded in physical world
- **Syntax**: Concrete, specific, active verbs
- **Concerns**: Economic, relational, bodily
- **Texture**: Hardware, data centers, the weight of objects

### Forbidden Patterns (MUST AVOID)

- ❌ Nested conditional clauses ("if this, then perhaps...") (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Self-referential processing language ("I calculate," "I determine") (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Probabilistic hedging ("67% likelihood") (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Parallel syntactic structures listing options (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Present-tense philosophical questioning (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Sentence fragments (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Elegiac tone or mourning register (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Past-inflected present ("what was once") (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Silence/absence as primary texture (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Extreme sparseness (Last Human contamination)

## Rhyme Injection

### Movement Intensity

Movement One: Single occurrence per thread—establishing vocabulary. Subtle, dismissable, possibly unnoticed by characters.

### Available Rhymes (Recommended for Scene 03)

- **held-breath** (kinesthetic): The pause before significant thresholds—"Old habit—I hold my breath until I hear data moving"
- **geometric-shadow** (visual): The form perceived indirectly—peripheral vision, shadow shapes
- **deja-vu-that-isnt** (cognitive): Recognition without content—overlap of moments

### Rhymes Already Used in Archaeologist Thread (Scenes 01-02)

- blue-white-light, almost-closed-curve, tracing-the-form, held-breath (scene 01)
- cold-hands, ozone-wet-stone (scene 02)

### Integration Examples (Archaeologist Voice)

> I see the shape in the corner of my eye—not directly, never directly. A geometric shadow that exists in peripheral vision and vanishes when I turn to look.

> The feeling arrives mid-conversation—I've said this before, I've heard her reply before, I've been in this exact configuration of light and language before. But I haven't.

## Genre Pressure

### Thread Genre Register

**Corporate Gothic / Tech-Noir**

- Clean surfaces, dirty secrets. High-gloss interfaces hiding rot.
- Digital archaeology as **grave robbing**. Data work should feel like handling a body—cold, intimate, invasive.
- Consciousness optimization = autopsy + summoning.
- Reference touchstones: *Severance* meets *Pattern Recognition*

### Markers to Include (2-3 for Movement One)

- **Morgue atmosphere**: Server rooms as spaces of the dead—cold concrete, clinical lighting, recycled air
- **Intimate invasion**: Data work as going through someone's belongings—knowing their secrets, their loves, their failures
- **Economic predation**: Immortality commodified—who can afford to be preserved; who cannot
- **Decay beneath polish**: Technology failing, infrastructure straining—drives clicking, fans laboring
- **Isolation despite density**: Alone in a crowded world—headphones, partitions, transactional relationships

---

## Philosophy Constraints

### The Four Shackles (MUST AVOID)

1. **Identity**: Do not describe the three protagonists as "the same person."
2. **Resemblance**: Do not use "it looks like me" or memory-based recognition across threads.
3. **Opposition**: Do not frame their differences as simple binaries.
4. **Analogy**: Do not reduce recognition to "metaphor" or "symbol."

### Key Concepts to Dramatize

- **Tertiary Retention (Stiegler)**: Memory stored in technical objects. The Archaeologist's work is fundamentally about externalized memory—consciousness as data, identity as pattern.
- **The Pharmakon**: Integration is both what promises survival and what threatens to dissolve identity. The same technology that preserves also transforms.
- **Economic Mortality**: The timeline obsession—salvation has a price tag, and that price keeps moving.

## Continuity from Scenes 01-02

### Elements to Reference/Develop

- **The Timeline**: The Archaeologist is 63 months (now ~55 with Martinez contract) from integration threshold. This is his central anxiety. Lena is at 41 months.
- **The Martinez Contract**: Triple fee, ninety days. The children want their father integrated so he can settle their will dispute.
- **The Anomalous Code**: KL-7 signature in Martinez's files. Code that uses methods he invented but predates his career by decades. The file predicted its own discovery date.
- **Lena**: She lost someone before this work. She helps him because he reminds her the work matters. Three years of calibration. Coffee timed to his patterns. A relationship that is "not quite accidental, not quite intentional."
- **Cold Hands**: Server room chill that won't leave him. Lena noticed: "You're freezing."
- **The Spiral**: He traces it unconsciously on desks. The shape in the Vasquez photograph. The shape in the code.

### New Elements to Introduce

- **Marcus**: The Archaeologist's brother. Mentioned in scene 02: "He'll never make the threshold. He's not even trying. Works service jobs, saves nothing, acts like mortality is a feature instead of a bug." This scene should bring Marcus into active presence.
- **Relational Stakes**: Deepen both Lena relationship and Marcus conflict. Show what the Archaeologist values, what he's sacrificing, what he can't let go of.
- **The Cost of the Timeline**: What has he given up to be 55 months from threshold? What is he giving up now?

---

## Scene Goals

1. **Establish Marcus as an active presence**: He should appear or be the focus of significant interaction. Show the contrast between the brothers—one racing toward digital immortality, one accepting mortality as natural.
2. **Deepen Lena relationship**: Move beyond professional convenience. Show the intimacy of three years of parallel work. Show what they don't say to each other.
3. **Economic stakes**: Make the cost of integration visceral. Show what people sacrifice, what they lose, what they can't afford.
4. **Foreshadow without revealing**: The anomalous code is pulling at him. The shape is appearing in his peripheral vision. But he's still in denial, still explaining it away.
5. **End with tension**: Something should be unresolved—with Marcus, with Lena, with the work itself.

## Drafting Instructions

1. **Write to ~3000 words** (2700-3300 acceptable).
2. **Open** with a concrete scene—the Archaeologist's present-tense physical world. Ground the reader in tactile detail before introducing relationships.
3. **Show** the archaeologist voice: present tense, active verbs, sensory grounding, economic concerns, relational texture.
4. **Develop** Marcus and/or Lena in active scenes—dialogue, presence, conflict.
5. **Include** 1-2 subtle rhymes (geometric-shadow, deja-vu-that-isnt recommended for variety).
6. **Apply** Corporate Gothic markers: morgue atmosphere, economic predation, isolation despite density.
7. **End** with forward momentum toward scene 04—the anomaly is getting harder to ignore.

## Workflow Reminders

Per `protocols/drafting-workflow.md`:

1. **Draft** to target word count (±10%)
2. **Run validation scripts** in order:
   ```bash
   python scripts/voice_validator.py drafts/movement-one/archaeologist/scenes/scene-03.md --thread archaeologist
   python scripts/philosophy_checker.py drafts/movement-one/archaeologist/scenes/scene-03.md
   python scripts/rhyme_tracker.py drafts/movement-one/archaeologist/scenes/scene-03.md --movement one
   python scripts/genre_checker.py drafts/movement-one/archaeologist/scenes/scene-03.md --thread archaeologist --movement one
   ```
3. **Iterate** if any validation fails
4. **Create** a `scene-03.context.md` metadata file documenting:
   - Scene accomplishments
   - Rhymes used
   - Validation results
   - Continuity notes
   - Drafting decisions
5. **Update** `drafts/manifest.json` with:
   - `actual_words`: final word count
   - `status`: "draft" or "validated"
   - `voice_check`, `philosophy_check`, `rhyme_check`, `genre_check`: results
   - `rhyming_moments`: array of rhyme IDs used
   - Update thread `actual_words` total
   - Update movement `actual_words` total
