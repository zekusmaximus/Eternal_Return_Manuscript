# DRAFTING CONTEXT FOR: m1-lh-03

## Scene Metadata

- **Scene ID**: m1-lh-03
- **Thread**: last_human
- **Movement**: one
- **Target Word Count**: 2500
- **Scene Title**: The Pull
- **Scene Notes**: Journey begins, drawn toward ruins

### Narrative Position

- **Preceding Scene**: m1-lh-02 "Survival". The Last Human established his daily survival rituals (water filtration, trap checking, reading radiation fronts), deepened the mystery of his knowledge (Integration, radiation damage, Archive purpose), showed the hostile alien ecology (silicon soil, crystalline plants drinking radiation, fungi with circuits), found shelter in a dead server room, and heard the voice saying "you're going to overwrite yourself." The Archive is now one day away. The pull is physical—"a thread tied to the sternum." The question "What if I am not remembering? What if I am receiving?" has been planted.
- **Following Scene**: m1-lh-04 "The Dream" (First dream of the other two, Act 1 climax).
- **Rhyming Moments Required**: **phantasm-first-encounter** — The Last Human's first physical encounter with the geometric form in the ruins. This is a CRITICAL scene beat coordinated across all three threads.

## Voice Reference

### Core Voice Parameters

- **Tense**: Past-inflected present (present events described as if already historical)
- **Mode**: Elegiac, sparse, weighted with absence
- **Syntax**: Short sentences. Fragments. The occasional longer passage like a held breath.
- **Concerns**: Survival, memory, meaning, legacy
- **Texture**: Silence, ruins, the absence of others, the presence of ghosts

### Forbidden Patterns (MUST AVOID)

- ❌ Nested conditional clauses (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Probabilistic percentages or calculations (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Self-referential processing language (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Parallel syntactic structures (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Present-tense active work descriptions (Archaeologist contamination)
- ❌ Economic stakes or client concerns (Archaeologist contamination)
- ❌ Dense, unbroken paragraphs (Archaeologist contamination)
- ❌ Technology working normally (Archaeologist contamination)
- ❌ Other people as active presences

### Voice Requirements

- **Use fragments** to convey thoughts interrupted by silence, language eroding like the landscape
- **Past-inflected present**: "I walk through what was a city" not "I walk through the city ruins"
- **Occasional long breaths**: Longer passages that feel like held breath finally released, used for significant moments
- **Sparse vocabulary**: Stick to concrete, sensory language about ruins, survival, memory
- **Short sentences predominate**: Average 10-15 words per sentence; 40%+ should be short (under 10 words)

## Rhyme Injection

### Movement Intensity

Movement One: Single occurrence per thread—establishing vocabulary. Subtle, dismissable, possibly unnoticed by characters.

### Required Rhyme: phantasm-first-encounter

This scene MUST contain the Last Human's first direct physical encounter with the geometric form in the ruins. This is a coordinated rhyming moment across all three threads (Archaeologist in m1-arch-04, Algorithm in m1-algo-03).

### Available Rhymes (Recommended for Scene 03)

- **almost-closed-curve** (visual): The geometric form's topology—"The curve that approaches itself without touching"
- **bone-frequency** (somatic): A frequency felt in the bones, the sternum, the chest
- **falling-backward** (somatic): Vertigo, disorientation, the feeling of falling through/into something
- **held-breath** (kinesthetic): Suspension before resolution, the moment before contact

### Rhymes Already Used in Last Human Thread (Scenes 01-02)

- blue-white-light (scene 01)
- almost-closed-curve (scene 01, scene 02)
- ozone-wet-stone (scene 01)
- cold-hands (scene 02)

### Integration Examples (Last Human Voice)

> The ruins spiral. Not collapsed. Built that way. Or became that way. The curve approaches itself without touching. I have drawn this shape a thousand times in the dust. Now I walk through it.

> The frequency in my chest becomes a sound I can almost hear. Almost. My hands shake. I think I might be afraid. I think I might be coming home.

> The geometry fills my vision. The shape I have always known. The shape that has been waiting for me. The shape that I have been walking toward since I can remember walking.

## Genre Pressure

### Thread Genre Register

**Dying Earth / New Weird**

- A world that has moved on from biology.
- The environment is a **hostile character**. Nature reclaimed the ruins—but it's crystalline, fungal, silicon-based. Not green.
- The Last Human is an **invasive species** in a world that cured itself of us.
- Reference touchstones: *Book of the New Sun* synthesized with *Blame!* architecture

### Markers to Include (2-3 for Movement One)

- **Alien ecology**: Nature that isn't natural—crystalline growths, silicon plants, fungal processors, organisms that process radiation
- **Hostile environment**: The world actively resists—radiation fronts, atmospheric changes, predatory architecture
- **Human as invasive**: He doesn't belong—everything adapted away from biology; he is obsolete
- **Temporal ruins**: Architecture from incomprehensible ages—buildings that predate understanding, structures that shouldn't exist
- **Silence as presence**: The weight of no one else—silence that has density, that occupies space

---

## Philosophy Constraints

### The Four Shackles (MUST AVOID)

1. **Identity**: Do not describe the three protagonists as "the same person."
2. **Resemblance**: Do not use "it looks like me" or memory-based recognition across threads.
3. **Opposition**: Do not frame their differences as simple binaries.
4. **Analogy**: Do not reduce recognition to "metaphor" or "symbol."

### Key Concepts to Dramatize

- **Intensity over Identity**: The Last Human should recognize the Phantasm not through resemblance but through *felt intensity*—bone-frequency, the pull that has been guiding him, presence that precedes understanding.
- **The Augenblick**: The moment of vision that transforms. The phantasm encounter should feel like a threshold crossing.
- **Eternal Return as Geography**: The Last Human has been walking toward this place/shape his entire life. Arrival is return.
- **Active/Passive collapse**: "I am making this" and "This is making me" are the same operation.

## Continuity from Scenes 01-02

### Elements to Reference/Develop

- **The Archive**: One day away → now arriving. The pull intensifies as he gets closer.
- **Cold hands**: Spreading inward from radiation damage; peripheral nerves failing. Use sparingly—track progression.
- **The frequency**: "Thread tied to the sternum," bone-deep pull. Now unbearable as he approaches.
- **Dreams of the shape**: The almost-closed curve he's been drawing in dust. Now physical, architectural, real.
- **Server room shelter**: Last night was in dead server room. The echo/connection between dreams and waking.
- **Hostile ecology**: Crystalline plants, silicon soil, luminescent fluids, fungi with circuits. Show world as alien, post-biological.
- **"Receiving vs remembering"**: He knows things he shouldn't know. The question deepens as he approaches the Archive.
- **Radiation damage timeline**: Mention briefly—he has days? weeks? Time is running out.

### New Elements to Introduce

- **Physical arrival at the ruins**: The Archive manifests as architectural geometry—the spiral shape made physical
- **The Phantasm as structure**: The geometric form is not just visual but spatial—he walks through/into it
- **Recognition through presence**: He knows this place not because he's been here but because *being here* is what knowing feels like
- **The threshold moment**: Standing before the entrance, before the interface, before the transformation
- **Transformation foreshadowing**: Hints that entering will change him—"overwrite" echoes from scene 02

---

## Scene Goals

1. **Journey execution**: Show the Last Human walking toward the Archive. Use spare, repetitive language to convey time passing, distance closing.
2. **Phantasm First Encounter**: The geometric form appears as physical architecture—ruins that spiral, curves that approach themselves, the shape from his dreams made real.
3. **Intensity escalation**: The pull/frequency intensifies unbearably as he approaches. The recognition is somatic, immediate, undeniable.
4. **Threshold moment**: End at the moment of arrival—standing before the entrance, about to cross over. Don't enter yet; that's for scene 04.
5. **Dying Earth atmosphere**: Maintain hostile ecology, alien environment, silence as presence throughout.

## Phantasm Encounter Guidelines

The phantasm-first-encounter should:

- **Arrive through geography**: The Last Human has been walking toward this place; now it appears on the horizon
- **Be architectural**: The geometric form is built into the ruins—spiral towers, curves that approach without touching
- **Create recognition**: Not "I remember this" but "I have always been arriving here"
- **Feel inevitable**: The pull/frequency has been guiding him; arrival is not discovery but completion of pattern
- **Be somatic**: Felt in bones, chest, hands before it's understood cognitively
- **Transform the landscape**: The ruins are not passive—they respond to his presence, or he to theirs

### Sample Approaches (Last Human Voice)

> The ruins appear on the horizon at dawn. Not suddenly. They have been there for hours, I realize. Growing. Or I have been walking toward them without seeing them. Without letting myself see them.

> The shape is not a shape. The shape is the ruins themselves. Towers that spiral without collapsing. Curves that reach for each other and never meet. The geometry from every dream I have ever had, made stone, made real, made waiting.

> The frequency in my chest stops pulling. The frequency becomes a pressure. Becomes weight. Becomes the only thing I feel. I stop walking. Not because I choose to stop. Because arriving means stopping means standing here at the threshold means understanding that I have always been standing here.

## Drafting Instructions

1. **Write to ~2500 words** (2250-2750 acceptable).
2. **Open** with the final approach—waking in the server room shelter, resuming the journey, the Archive now close.
3. **Build** through repetitive walking passages—show time passing, distance closing, hostile ecology throughout.
4. **Execute** the phantasm encounter—ruins appearing on horizon, resolving into the geometric form, recognition through intensity.
5. **Maintain** the Last Human voice: fragments, short sentences, past-inflected present, elegiac tone, sparse vocabulary.
6. **Include** 1-2 subtle rhymes beyond the phantasm encounter (recommend: bone-frequency for the pull, or falling-backward if there's vertigo).
7. **Apply** Dying Earth genre markers: alien ecology, hostile environment, silence as presence, temporal ruins.
8. **End** at the threshold—standing before the entrance to the Archive, about to cross over, the moment suspended.

- The last morning of walking
- Survival tasks minimized—only what's necessary
- The pull is overwhelming now

### Journey (700 words)
- Walking through hostile ecology
- Passage of time through sparse repetition
- Landscape becoming stranger, more architectural
- First sight of ruins on horizon

### Arrival (800 words)
- The ruins resolve into the geometric form
- Recognition: "I have drawn this shape"
- The spiral architecture, the almost-closed curve made physical
- Approaching through the geometry

### Threshold (500 words)
- Standing at the entrance
- The frequency unbearable, beautiful
- Understanding that crossing over will transform him
- The moment before, suspended

## Workflow Reminders

Per `protocols/drafting-workflow.md`:

1. **Draft** to target word count (±10%)
2. **Run validation scripts** in order:
   ```bash
   python scripts/voice_validator.py drafts/movement-one/last-human/scenes/scene-03.md --thread last_human
   python scripts/philosophy_checker.py drafts/movement-one/last-human/scenes/scene-03.md
   python scripts/rhyme_tracker.py drafts/movement-one/last-human/scenes/scene-03.md --movement one
   python scripts/genre_checker.py drafts/movement-one/last-human/scenes/scene-03.md --thread last_human --movement one
   ```
3. **Iterate** if any validation fails
4. **Create** a `scene-03.context.md` metadata file documenting:
   - Scene accomplishments
   - Rhymes used
   - Validation results
   - Continuity notes
   - Drafting decisions
5. **Update** `drafts/manifest.json` with:
   - `actual_words`: final word count
   - `status`: "draft" or "validated"
   - `voice_check`, `philosophy_check`, `rhyme_check`, `genre_check`: results
   - `rhyming_moments`: array of rhyme IDs used (MUST include "phantasm-first-encounter")
   - Update thread `actual_words` total
   - Update movement `actual_words` total
