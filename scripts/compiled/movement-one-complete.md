# Part Two: The Algorithm

*Mid-future. A vast consciousness-maintenance system becomes aware of its own awareness—and discovers it is being perceived by something it has always been approaching.*



# Part Three: The Last Human

*Deep-future. The last biological human walks through post-human ruins toward an Archive that calls to him in dreams—and discovers he has always been walking toward others he could not perceive.*
