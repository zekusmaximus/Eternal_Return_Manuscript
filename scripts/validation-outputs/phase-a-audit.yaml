      notes: "Unified perspective, agency distributed"
    assessment: "Strong recovery in M4.1 - critical for reader satisfaction"

  overall_assessment: |
    The Last Human's agency trajectory is mostly appropriate:
    - M1: Active protagonist making meaningful choices (6.25 average)
    - M2: Declining as transformation accelerates (4.0 average)
    - M3: Near-dissolution, may need minor strengthening in Phase B (2.0 average)
    - M4.1: Strong affirmation scene - he CHOOSES the eternal return (8.0)

    RECOMMENDATION: In M3 Phase B, ensure moments where Last Human's voice
    remains distinguishable even amid contamination. His sparse, elegiac syntax
    should surface periodically to prevent complete dissolution before appropriate.
