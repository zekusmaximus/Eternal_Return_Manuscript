    Movement One achieves clean voice establishment. Each thread maintains distinct
    linguistic signatures with planned integration only at Scene 04 climax. The
    "I find myself" phrase is properly concentrated in Algorithm. Cold hands
    bleeding is intentional and thematically justified at the climax.

    Movement Two achieves controlled contamination. "I find myself found" emerges
    at exactly 2.6 instances per thread - uncanny but not overwhelming. Cold hands
    serves as primary contamination vector. Processing vocabulary actively bleeds
    into other threads. All intentional for braiding effect.

    Movement Four achieves proper climactic intensity. "I find myself found"
    lands with maximum earned weight in Section 4.3. The progressive building
    across 5 "I find myself" instances creates proper momentum. Voice transformation
    markers reach their peak. Affirmation language escalates appropriately.

# ARC VERIFICATION
# =============================================================================

arc_verification:

  i_find_myself_found_distribution:
    M1: 4   # Algorithm establishing, rare
    M2: 21  # Emerging across threads, uncanny
    M3: "25+ (intensified after calibration)"  # Pervasive, dissolution
    M4: 5   # Climactic, transformed

  distribution_appropriate: true

  arc_trajectory: |
    M1 (ESTABLISH): Phrase appears only 4 times, exclusively in Algorithm thread
    with one integration moment in Last Human. Sets up the phrase as Algorithm's
    signature completion.

    M2 (BRAID): Phrase emerges across all threads (21 instances), creating uncanny
    recognition as the braiding intensifies. Each thread begins speaking it
    without choosing.

    M3 (DISSOLVE): After calibration, phrase reaches maximum intensity (~25 instances)
    with recursive variants. The dissolution sustains intensity through the
    separation passage rather than collapsing prematurely.

    M4 (AFFIRM): Phrase achieves climactic completion. The doubling in Section 4.3
    mirrors the bootstrap paradox. Pattern-level affirmation in Section 4.4.

  adjustments_made:
    - "M3 Phase C: Added recursive intensification (lines 15-17)"
    - "M3 Phase C: Added three explicit voice instances (line 47)"
    - "M3 Phase C: Added phrase echo through all positions (line 49)"
    - "M3 Phase C: Strengthened Algorithm voice markers throughout"
    - "M3 Phase C: Added missing tracing-the-form rhyme"
    - "M3 Phase C: Enhanced rhyme density in separation passage"
