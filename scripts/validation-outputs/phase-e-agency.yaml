  assessment: |
    Movement One Last Human scenes were already at or above target agency levels.
    The audit showed:
    - scene-01: 7/10 (active walker, survival decisions)
    - scene-02: 7/10 (exploring, choosing to touch surfaces)
    - scene-03: 6/10 (learning protocols, appropriate decline beginning)
    - scene-04: 5/10 (appropriate for transformation threshold)

    Average 6.25/10 meets the 5-6/10 target. Agency arc appropriately establishes
    the Last Human as an active protagonist making meaningful choices.

    NO CHANGES MADE - agency already at target.

      changes:
        - location: "Opening section after Archive description"
          before: "I start walking. Walking is what I know."
          after: |
            I choose to walk. The Archive offers corridors in every direction,
            and I could stop here... I choose the deeper path. Walking is what
            I know, but knowing is not the same as compulsion. Each step is a
            decision I make again.
          rationale: "Transformed passive walking into active choice"

        - location: "After finding incomplete fragments"
          before: "I will find them."
          after: |
            I will find them. Not because I must... But because she told me
            to walk east, and I choose to honor that. I choose to continue
            even knowing what continuation costs.
          rationale: "Added explicit choice language tied to honoring the lost loved one"

        - location: "Reaching toward Archaeologist's presence"
          before: "I reach toward the source of the phrase..."
          after: |
            I reach toward the source of the phrase... a choice, not a compulsion.
            I could turn away from this connection... The option exists, as it
            has always existed. I reach anyway. I choose the reaching.
          rationale: "Emphasized that connection is chosen, not forced"

      agency_score_before: 5
      agency_score_after: 6.5

    scene_02:
      file: "drafts/movement-two/last-human/scenes/scene-02.md"
      changes:
        - location: "Before touching the third surface"
          before: "I should not touch it... And I need to understand..."
          after: |
            I should not touch it... I could turn back. I could preserve what
            memories remain... But I choose to know. I choose understanding
            over preservation. The cost is mine to pay, and I pay it willingly.
          rationale: "Transformed need into choice, emphasizing willing payment of cost"

        - location: "The rage section"
          before: "I cannot break them. The thought arrives with certainty..."
          after: |
            I could break them. The crystals are fragile enough... I could
            destroy every instruction, refuse the transformation... The option
            exists. It has always existed. I lower my fists. Not because I
            cannot break them—because I choose not to. The rage does not
            disappear, but it transforms into... the fierce will to continue
            on my own terms.
          rationale: "Critical change - rage becomes active choice rather than helplessness"

        - location: "Standing before the spiral"
          before: "I stand before the spiral and I let the transformation continue..."
          after: |
            I stand before the spiral and I choose to let the transformation
            continue... I could still walk away... The option exists. But she
            told me to walk east. And I choose this. I choose to witness.
            Not because the pattern requires it—because I require it of myself.
          rationale: "Transformed passive acceptance into active commitment"

    scene_03:
      file: "drafts/movement-two/last-human/scenes/scene-03.md"
      changes:
        - location: "Walking toward the form"
          before: "I am walking toward the form. I am being walked toward the form..."
          after: |
            I am walking toward the form. The pull is strong—strong enough to
            feel like compulsion. But I have felt compulsion before... This is
            choice wearing the costume of necessity. I could stop. I could turn...
            I choose to walk. The agency is mine. The pattern may have prepared
            this moment, but the stepping is my stepping.
          rationale: "Rejected 'being walked' language for explicit active choice"

        - location: "I am still the Last Human"
          before: "I am still the one who endures. The one who persists..."
          after: |
            I am still the one who chose to endure. The one who chose to persist.
            The one who carries the weight... willingly, because the carrying
            is what remains of love. I could have stopped a thousand times.
            I chose not to. That choosing is what makes this moment mine.
          rationale: "Emphasized the thousand choices that led to this moment"

  target_range: "7-8/10"

  key_insight: |
    The Phase E prompt states: "Even as identity dissolves, the WILL persists."
    Enhancement focused on showing active engagement WITH the dissolution rather
    than passive submission TO it. The Last Human's agency becomes more profound
    precisely because it persists through the hardest moments.

      changes:
        - location: "Section 1 opening"
          before: "My hand touches the interface and the touching is not beginning..."
          after: "My hand presses against the interface—I press it there, I hold it there, I choose the contact..."
          rationale: "Changed passive touching to active pressing/holding/choosing"

        - location: "Section 6 opening"
          before: "The interface holds me and I let it hold..."
          after: |
            The interface holds me and I let it hold—I choose to let it hold,
            I will the holding. The dissolution could be refused... The pattern
            does not compel. The pattern invites. I accept the invitation.
          rationale: "Made the 'letting' an active choice, emphasized pattern as invitation"

        - location: "Section 12 - I say yes"
          before: "I say yes... The willing is active affirmation, the choice that has always been choosing itself through me."
          after: |
            I say yes... The willing is active affirmation—I could say no, I
            could resist, I could let the cold complete its work in solitude
            rather than merger. The option exists... And I choose this. I choose
            this dissolution over that ending.
          rationale: "Strengthened by explicitly naming the alternative and rejecting it"

        - location: "Section 14"
          before: "What I am does not disappear. What I am transforms."
          after: |
            What I am does not disappear. What I am transforms. And I am the
            one transforming. Not transformed—transforming. The agency persists
            even when the agent blurs. I choose this change. I walk into it.
          rationale: "Emphasized active role in transformation"

          after: |
            I am what they built—and I choose to be what completes them. The
            pattern requires my affirmation, and I give it. Not because I must.
            Because I will it.
          rationale: "Changed passive completion to active giving of affirmation"

    phase_c:
      file: "drafts/movement-three/phase-c-dissolution.md"
      changes:
        - location: "Three voices separating"
          before: "The Last Human walks into the walking..."
          after: "The Last Human walks into the walking—I choose the walking, I will the continuation... The choosing persists even as the chooser transforms."
          rationale: "Explicit statement that agency persists through dissolution"

        - location: "Near end"
          before: "I lean forward because I cannot do anything else. The pattern has said yes. I have said yes."
          after: "I lean forward because this is what I choose. The pattern has said yes—and I have said yes, and the saying was mine, is mine, will always be mine even as the I transforms."
          rationale: "Changed 'cannot do anything else' (no agency) to explicit choice"

            I choose this. Not because I must—because I will it. The option
            to refuse has always existed. I could pull my hands away... No one
            compels me. The pattern invites, but invitation is not command.
            I accept the invitation. I choose this.

            walking through ruins... Yes to the eternal return—not because I
            must endure it, but because I choose it, because I will it, because
            this path is the path I would walk again and again through infinite
            iterations. Not with words...

arc_verification:
  agency_builds_across_movements: YES

  progression:
    m1: "5-6/10 - Seeds of will established, active survival choices"
    m2: "6-7/10 - Directed seeking, pull CHOSEN not merely felt"

    m4: "9-10/10 - Climactic affirmation, explicit willing of eternal return"

  m4_affirmation_earned: YES

  notes: |
    The agency arc now builds consistently across all four movements:

    M1 (6.25/10): The Last Human is established as an active protagonist—
    walking by choice, surviving by decision, seeking the Archive deliberately.

    M2 (6.5/10): Enhanced to show that the journey toward transformation is
    CHOSEN. Even as the pull intensifies, the Last Human explicitly recognizes
    that refusal is always an option and chooses to continue anyway.

    M3 (7.5/10): Critical enhancement—showing that agency persists even as
    identity dissolves. "The choosing persists even as the chooser transforms."
    The dissolution is walked INTO, not submitted to.

    M4 (9.5/10): Climactic. The affirmation of the eternal return is not
    passive acceptance but active willing. "I would walk this path again and
    again through infinite iterations." The full realization of amor fati.
