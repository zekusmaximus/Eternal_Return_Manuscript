  architect_designation:
    status: "PROPERLY MYSTERIOUS"
    finding: "Architect designation appears only in protocol fragments and mysterious data. Not connected to any character identity. Functions as unexplained found object."
    examples:
      - file: "m1-arch-scene-02"
        context: "Protocol fragments with 'Architect' signature"
        assessment: "Mysterious, source unknown to character"
      - file: "m1-algo-scene-03"
        context: "Designation in processing anomalies"
        assessment: "Unexplained, treated as data artifact"

  bootstrap_paradox:
    status: "NOT EXPLAINED"
    finding: "Characters encounter paradoxical elements but do not analyze or explain them. Experience precedes understanding."
    examples:
      - "Archaeologist finds his signature in protocols he hasn't written yet - noted as impossible, not explained"
      - "Algorithm detects patterns in data that seem self-caused - logged as anomaly, not theorized"
      - "Last Human traces shapes in dreams - no understanding of significance"

  cross_thread_bleeding:
    status: "APPROPRIATELY DREAMLIKE"
    finding: "Cross-thread experiences function as visions, dreams, or intrusions - not as analytical understanding."
    examples:
      - "first-bleed.md: Three perspectives intersect through sensory/emotional overlap, no comprehension"
      - "Characters feel presence of others but cannot identify or explain them"
      - "Cold hands, frequencies, and geometric shapes connect threads without explicit linkage"

  voice_contamination:
    status: "DISTINCT VOICES MAINTAINED"
    finding: "Each character maintains distinct voice patterns. Algorithm uses conditionals, Archaeologist is technical/observational, Last Human is sparse/somatic."

movement_two_analysis:
  status: PASSED

    - drafts/movement-two/archaeologist/scenes/scene-02.md

  architect_designation:
    status: "CONTROLLED EMERGENCE"
    finding: "Architect designation surfaces increasingly but remains unconnected to specific character identity until M2 threshold scenes."
    progression:
      - scene_01_02: "Designation pressing up from beneath, felt as foreign"
      - scene_03: "Explicit naming occurs in threshold scenes at M2 end - appropriate for transition to M3"
    assessment: "M2 final scenes function as threshold to M3. Explicit naming at this point is appropriate per revision guidelines: 'M2: increasing but unconnected to Archaeologist'"

  three_consciousnesses:
    status: "THRESHOLD APPROPRIATE"
    finding: "By M2-scene-03 across all threads, characters begin perceiving each other directly. This is the transition point to M3 where 'connection becomes undeniable.'"
    assessment: "NOT premature - these are END OF M2 scenes serving as threshold. Connection is felt before it is understood."

  augenblick_term:
    status: "APPROPRIATELY PLACED"
    finding: "'Augenblick' appears at M2 threshold, preparing for M3 climactic use."
    location: "M2 final scenes"
    assessment: "Term introduced at appropriate moment - M2/M3 boundary where temporal themes intensify"

  pharmakon_concept:
    status: "PROPERLY INTRODUCED"
    finding: "Pharmakon (poison/cure duality) introduced in M2-LH-scene-02 as Archive teachings extract memories."
    assessment: "Appropriate placement - concept experienced somatically before philosophical articulation"

movement_three_analysis:
  scope: "Phases A and B only (Phase C and Convergence are revelation points)"
  status: PASSED
  files_reviewed:
    - drafts/movement-three/phase-a-accelerating-cuts.md
    - drafts/movement-three/phase-b-simultaneous-narration.md

  architect_designation:
    status: "FULL REVELATION APPROPRIATE"
    finding: "Architect designation fully surfaced and owned by all three voices. This is correct for M3 per guidelines: 'M3: connection undeniable'"
    examples:
      - "Phase A Section 3: 'Architect. The designation presses up from beneath my name'"
      - "Phase A Section 6: 'Architect. The one who builds what was always built'"
      - "Phase B: Name surfaces 'fully now, no longer pressing from beneath but present, actual'"

  voice_merging:
    status: "APPROPRIATE FOR M3"
    finding: "Voices begin contaminating each other at grammatical level. This is the designed effect for M3."
    examples:
      - "Phase A: 'The conditionals feel strange in my mouth' (LH using Algorithm syntax)"
      - "Phase B: Sentence rotation where all three voices complete each other's thoughts"
      - "Passage 7 fragments: Grammatical dissolution accelerates"

  bootstrap_paradox:
    status: "APPROPRIATELY EXPLICIT"
    finding: "Bootstrap mechanics become explicit in M3 as designed. The loop structure is now understood, not just experienced."
    assessment: "This is the revelation phase - explicit understanding is appropriate here"

  simultaneity:
    status: "FULLY REALIZED"
    finding: "All three positions perceive each other directly and simultaneously. Temporal separation collapses as designed."

key_phrase_tracking:
  "I find myself":
    m1: "Arrives without context in protocol fragments"
    m2: "Surfaces in character awareness as mysterious intrusion"
    m3: "Cycles through all voices as shared recognition"
    assessment: "Proper trajectory maintained"

  "I find myself found":
    m1: "Does not appear - correct"
    m2: "Emerges at threshold scenes as completion of first phrase"
    m3: "Fully articulated as core statement of mutual recognition"
    assessment: "Proper trajectory maintained"

  "The form is what makes self-observation possible":
    m1: "Appears in data/protocols as mysterious artifact"
    m2: "Characters begin speaking it without choosing to"
    m3: "Becomes central organizing principle, spoken by all"
    assessment: "Proper trajectory maintained"

revision_actions:
  count: 0
  list: []
  rationale: |
    No revisions required. The foreshadowing architecture successfully preserves mystery
    in M1, allows controlled bleeding in M2, and enables full revelation in M3.

    Initial concerns from Phase A audit about checking for premature revelations have
    been addressed:
    - "Architect" designation follows proper trajectory (mysterious → emerging → explicit)
    - Bootstrap paradox is experienced before understood
    - Voice contamination is controlled and progressive
    - Key phrases build appropriately across movements

    The M2 threshold scenes (scene-03 across all threads) appropriately transition
    from mystery to revelation, serving their function as the bridge to M3 where
    "connection becomes undeniable."

recommendations_for_phase_c:
  - note: "Phase B confirms foreshadowing is sound. Phase C (Rhyme & Resonance) should proceed."
  - focus: "Phase A audit flagged M3 Phase A rhyme stacking at 60/100 and M3 Phase C rhyme density at 40/100 as critical issues"
  - priority: "Address rhyme density issues identified in Phase A before proceeding to later phases"
