    key_finding: |
      The rhyme architecture is fundamentally sound. Movement One establishes
      home rhymes firmly in each thread. Movement Two introduces strategic
      contamination that escalates appropriately across three cycles. All
      rhyme handoffs create ligaments between scenes. Movement Three achieves
      saturation. Movement Four transforms every rhyme from uncanny/threatening
      to comfort/home/love.

      The only weak point identified and repaired was the Last Human scene-01,
      which lacked its native home rhymes (waking-into-motion, name-edge-of-memory).
      Two targeted additions now anchor these rhymes at the opening of that thread.

    dissolution_preparation: |
      The anchoring fully prepares for dissolution:
      - M1 plants sensory vocabulary readers will unconsciously track
      - M2 contamination creates the uncanny recognition before understanding
      - M2 handoffs ensure rhymes flow continuously through braided structure
      - M3 saturation achieves the layering the scaffolding specifies
      - M4 transformation completes the arc from intrusion to home
