- Rhyme handoff chains: VERIFIED (6/6 functional)
- Braiding effectiveness: VERIFIED

## Movement Three
- Dissolution progression: VERIFIED (A->B->C->Convergence)
- Climax intensity: VERIFIED
- Augenblick achieved: VERIFIED

## Movement Four
- Affirmation earned: VERIFIED
- Transformation present: VERIFIED
- Bootstrap resolution: VERIFIED (properly mysterious)

## Cross-Movement Arc
