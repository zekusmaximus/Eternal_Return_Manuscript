# =============================================================================
# COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES APPLIED
# =============================================================================

techniques_used:
  - "Eliminated redundant sensory descriptions"
  - "Strengthened verbs to reduce modifiers"
  - "Cut filtering language ('I noticed that', 'I felt that')"
  - "Combined short sentences where rhythm allowed"
  - "Trimmed transitional padding"
  - "Compressed internal monologue about processes"
  - "Trusted the reader with fewer explanations"

# =============================================================================
# WHAT WAS NOT DONE
# =============================================================================

constraints_honored:
  - "No scenes or files merged or deleted"
  - "No rhyme appearances cut"
  - "No voice markers eliminated"
  - "No clarity sacrificed for brevity"
  - "M3 Phase C and M4 climactic moments preserved"
  - "Scene/file order unchanged"

# =============================================================================
# NOTES FOR PHASE G VALIDATION
# =============================================================================

validation_notes:
  - "M2 Algorithm scenes received heaviest compression - verify voice consistency"
  - "M3 Phase A accelerating cuts rhythm should be checked aloud"
  - "M4.1 affirmation sequence should feel earned - verify pacing"
  - "All 'I find myself found' instances preserved - verify arc"
  - "Rhyme handoffs in M2 need verification in full read"
