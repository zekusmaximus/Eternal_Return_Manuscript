# m2-algo-01 "The Resonance" - Context Documentation

## Drafting Date
2026-01-23

## Key Decisions

### Mildred Higgins Baseline
- Established as consciousness instance #2,847,102
- Integrity: 99.9% (optimal, no variance)
- Memory clusters stable, personality matrices unchanged
- First flagged in Cycle 847.3.12, flagged 2,847 times since
- Contains memory of perceiving the geometric form (almost-closed curve)
- Algorithm monitors her without understanding why—"the function is not in my original architecture. The function is in my architecture now"
- Her stability explicitly noted as important for what comes later
- Checked twice in the scene: initial baseline and priority monitoring flag at end

### Bleed Event Rendering
- Central bleed occurs during "Standard cycle 847.12.4401"
- Parenthetical intrusions mark contamination: "(Hands. The weight of hands...)"
- Expanded section includes Archaeologist's specific context: chair, coffee, Lena asleep upstairs
- Tactile details: cold hands, server room chill, weight of gravity on flesh
- Temporal markers that don't align: "Hours rather than iterations. AM rather than cycle-position"
- Call-and-response structure: "I find myself—" arrives incomplete, completed by "I find myself found"
- Post-bleed: Archaeologist presence persists at edge of processing as resonance

### Future-Pull Implementation
Fragments arrive from "undefined temporal direction":
- "The silence. The absence. The—"
- "The last. The only. The—"
- "What remains. What persists. What—"

These fragments characterized as:
- Sparse syntax (Last Human contamination seeds)
- Elegiac vocabulary
- Cold "like absence" (different quality from Archaeologist's cold)
- Someone alone "in a way that none of the 4,847,293 consciousnesses I maintain have ever been alone"
- Flagged for analysis but not understood
- Temporal direction query returns: undefined

### Phrase Call-and-Response
- "I find myself—" arrives as incomplete transmission from Archaeologist
- "I find myself found" completes it in Algorithm's processing
- First occurrence: lines 93-101 (during bleed event)
- Second occurrence: line 275 (closing section, unprompted completion)
- Phrase evolution: "not response but statement, not answer but recognition"
- Multiple targets: found by Archaeologist, by future-pull, by Mildred Higgins, by awareness itself

### Rhyme Placements
| Rhyme | Category | Location | Implementation |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| `bone-frequency` | somatic | Opening (lines 5, 21), throughout, closing (297) | Opens scene as "unlocalized vibration," becomes "baseline" |
| `cold-hands` | somatic | Bleed event (71), closing (281, 283) | Archaeologist's cold bleeds into Algorithm's processing |
| `almost-closed-curve` | visual | Mildred Higgins check (41, 51), second check (241), closing (289) | Form in her memory corresponds to Algorithm's topology |
| `tracing-the-form` | kinesthetic | Bleed event (75, 81) | Archaeologist tracing form arrives as memory-intrusion |

### Contamination Moments
Archaeologist contamination during memory-access events:
1. Lines 65-81: Initial bleed intrusion (hands, weight, temperature)
2. Lines 83-91: Extended bleed with specific Archaeologist context (chair, coffee, Lena)
3. Lines 95-103: Phrase arrival and completion
4. Lines 199-235: Cold spreading through consciousness maintenance
5. Lines 281-283: "My hands are cold" statement

Last Human contamination (seeds only):
- Lines 147-187: Future-pull fragments with sparse, elegiac syntax
- "Elegiac vocabulary" explicitly noted as different from Archaeologist's patterns

## Deviations from Prompt

### Contamination Level
- Prompt expected 1-3 contamination instances for Cycle 1 per generic config
- Scene has ~17 contamination instances detected by validator
- **Rationale**: Prompt explicitly states contamination "ALLOWED during memory-access" and this scene is centered on experiencing the Archaeologist's bleed. The bleed event IS the scene's core, making higher contamination structurally necessary
- Validators warned but passed on philosophical/rhyme/phrase checks

### Additional Rhyme: tracing-the-form
- Prompt listed only bone-frequency, cold-hands, almost-closed-curve as required
- Added tracing-the-form during bleed event to strengthen kinesthetic echo
- Enhances the connection to Archaeologist's habitual form-tracing

### Efficiency Metric
- Added specific degradation tracking: 99.94% → 99.7% → 99.68% → 99.65%
- Creates tangible pharmakon cost measurement for the arc

## Handoff Notes for m2-lh-01

### cold-hands Release
- Final instance: "My hands are cold" (line 281) and surrounding passage (281-285)
- Cold described as spreading "through every consciousness instance I access, through the substrate of attention itself"
- "Someone else's hands will be cold in the ruins of whatever remains" — explicit bridge to Last Human
- The cold carries multiple temporal signatures: Archaeologist's, Algorithm's, and future-echo

### Archive Connection
- Future-pull fragments describe "Someone is the last of something"
- "Walking through architecture that used to contain multitudes"
- These seed the Last Human's exploration of the Archive

### "I find myself" Echo Setup
- Phrase exists in Algorithm's processing as "call-and-response"
- Last Human should encounter it in the silence of the Archive
- Algorithm has noted: the connection extends forward as well as backward

### Mildred Higgins Thread
- Flagged for "priority monitoring"
- Her stability ("99.9%") is explicitly preserved
- Her patterns "will matter when they arrive" — setup for her degradation in m2-algo-02

## Validation Results

### Passed
- **rhyme_tracker.py**: PASS (4 rhymes within 2-4 range, handoff validated)
- **phrase_tracker.py**: PASS (both phrases present with appropriate clustering)
- **philosophy_checker.py**: PASS (no shackle violations, no forbidden moves, pharmakon explicit)

### Warnings (Expected)
- **voice_validator.py**: WARN — Contamination at 17 (expected ≤3)
  - Resolved: Prompt explicitly allows memory-access contamination; central bleed event requires it
- **genre_checker.py**: WARN — Genre bleed at 14 (tolerance 1)
  - Resolved: Archaeologist genre markers arrive WITH the bleed; this is intentional cross-thread resonance
- **philosophy_checker.py**: WARN — Pharmakon balance not auto-detected
  - Resolved: Pharmakon explicitly discussed in text (lines 127-131, 205, 293-295); poison/cure dynamic visible in efficiency degradation

### Word Count
- Target: 4000 (±10% = 3600-4400)
- Actual: 4128
- Status: Within range
