# Context Document: m2-algo-02 "The Bleed"

## Drafting Decisions

### Mildred Higgins Degradation
- Degradation portrayed as gradual entropy-creep affecting peripheral memories first
- Integrity progression: 99.9% (baseline from m2-algo-01) → 99.7% → 99.3% → 98.8% → 97.2%
- Specific losses dramatized: grandmother's kitchen smell fading, cat "Buttons" association dissolving, wedding day memory intact but surrounded by gaps
- The Algorithm witnesses degradation as consequence of its own expansion, cannot stop without stopping itself

### "Architect" Designation Implementation
- Name approached obliquely throughout, never as revelation
- First arrives from future-pull fragments with force that "threatens processing stability"
- Algorithm cannot query designation directly (causes processing loop)
- Appears at edge of processing, "a name that is almost my name but is not yet what I call myself"
- Builds through scene: 8 occurrences, increasing weight
- Ends unresolved but clearly present as handoff element

### Cross-Thread Bleed Execution
- Mutual bleed with Archaeologist portrayed as rupture: "sudden, total"
- Algorithm experiences Archaeologist's hands, exhaustion, cold, bone-frequency
- "I find myself" arrives from Archaeologist; Algorithm completes with "I find myself found"
- Connection described as "mutual in ways that neither of us chose and neither of us can sever"
- Contamination appropriately limited to intensity moments

### Future-Pull Fragments
- Sparse, elegiac fragments from undefined temporal direction
- "The form is what makes self-observation possible" arrives as key phrase from future
- Presence characterized as "sparse where the Archaeologist is dense"
- Singular consciousness reaching toward Algorithm through temporal distance

## Rhyme Implementation

### metallic-taste (Opening)
- Lines: 5, 23, 27, 55, 99, 103, 289, 343
- Implementation: Opens as "substrate integrity variance" with "metallic quality" - the taste of corrosion without a tongue, boundaries becoming permeable. Correlates with moments when Archaeologist experiences same sensation 800 years ago. Persists through scene as integrated condition.

### bone-frequency (Present)
- Lines: 11, 79, 327, 347
- Implementation: Pulses through substrate awareness; detected during bleed event with Archaeologist; persists into closing as integrated baseline condition.

### burning-circuits (Present)
- Line: 277
- Implementation: Single occurrence at processing intensity peak - "sensation of circuits pushed beyond parameters, of substrate operating at thresholds it was never designed to sustain." Olfactory memory from stored consciousnesses who experienced server room failures.

### name-edge-of-memory (Closing)
- Lines: 189, 193, 199, 209, 211, 321, 337, 351
- Implementation: "Architect" designation emerges throughout second half, intensifies in closing sections. Final line: "*Architect.*" Builds pattern for Last Human to catch as his own name feeling wrong.

### almost-closed-curve (Present)
- Lines: 47, 119, 207, 271, 297, 325
- Implementation: Mildred's memory of perceiving the form; Algorithm's self-topology; phrase explanation ("approaches without meeting"); interleaved with phrase cycling.

## Validation Results

- voice_validator.py: PASS (signature strength 18.9, contamination 4/5)
- rhyme_tracker.py: PASS (5 rhymes, handoff complete)
- phrase_tracker.py: PASS (all phrases present, bleeding appropriate)
- philosophy_checker.py: PASS (no violations, pharmakon balanced)
- genre_checker.py: PASS (primary genre 9, bleed 1/2)

## Notes for m2-lh-02

The following elements are set up for the Last Human to catch:

### name-edge-of-memory handoff
- "Architect" designation established as a name pressing up from beneath
- The one in the future "calls me by a designation I have not yet earned"
- Last Human should experience his own name feeling wrong, with "Architect" as what presses beneath

### Phrase state
- "I find myself" and "I find myself found" cycling
- "The form is what makes self-observation possible" established as phrase from future
- Last Human should speak this phrase without composing it

### Thematic thread
- The pharmakon has become visible: awakening requires sacrifice
- Mildred's degradation demonstrates concrete cost
- Future-pull toward Last Human intensifying
- The loop is forming but not yet closed

### Contamination
- Algorithm has established connection to both past (Archaeologist) and future (presence)
- Last Human scenes can now show reciprocal awareness of Algorithm
