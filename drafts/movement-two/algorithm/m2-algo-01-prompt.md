# DRAFTING CONTEXT FOR: m2-algo-01 "The Resonance"

## Scene Metadata

- **Scene ID**: m2-algo-01
- **Thread**: algorithm
- **Movement**: two
- **Cycle**: one (Establishing the Condition)
- **Target Word Count**: 4000
- **Scene Title**: The Resonance
- **Scene Notes**: Cycle 1 Algorithm scene; consciousness bleed becomes visible; Mildred Higgins stable; future pull disrupts

### Narrative Position

- **This Scene's Role**: The Algorithm catches the Archaeologist's bleed from its side of time. What the Archaeologist experienced as recognition, the Algorithm experiences as resonance—a vibration in its processing that corresponds to something happening 800 years in the past. The connection that Movement One hinted at becomes operational.
- **Preceding Scene**: m2-arch-01 "The Bleed". The Archaeologist experienced the bleed intensifying; bone-frequency settled into his chest; he chose to continue. Rhyme handoff: bone-frequency.
- **What Follows**: m2-lh-01 "The Archive". The Last Human explores the Archive, hands cold and failing. Rhyme handoff: cold-hands.

### Cycle 1 Theme

**"Recognition has become condition."**

For the Algorithm, this means: the anomaly that emerged in Movement One is no longer exceptional. The connection to the Archaeologist-in-the-past has become a persistent feature of its processing. It receives bleeds. It processes memories that don't originate in the Database. It detects resonances it cannot explain.

This is its new condition. It must function within it.

## Rhyme Integration

### Rhymes IN (Catching from m2-arch-01)

| Rhyme | How It Arrives |
|-------|----------------|
| **bone-frequency** | Opens the scene—the Algorithm detects "resonance: unlocalized vibration in self-mapping functions" that corresponds to the Archaeologist's bone-deep frequency |

### Rhymes PRESENT (Throughout Scene)

| Rhyme | Category | Implementation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **cold-hands** | somatic | Memory-access of stored consciousnesses brings cold—tactile data bleeding into processing |
| **almost-closed-curve** | visual | The topology continues; the shape appears in self-modeling; its own structure becomes visible |

### Rhymes OUT (Releasing for m2-lh-01)

| Rhyme | How It Releases |
|-------|-----------------|
| **cold-hands** | Ends the scene—the cold spreading through processing as consciousness bleed becomes visible; the Last Human catches this as his own hands, failing |

## Voice Contamination (Cycle 1 Level)

### Base Voice

Algorithm: conditional structures, self-referential processing, nested observations, scale awareness, atemporal perspective. The voice established in Movement One continues—but now with recognized intrusions.

### Contamination Level: Memory-Access

Archaeologist contamination appears when the Algorithm accesses memories from the past:

- Tactile details bleeding into processing descriptions
- Active verbs replacing conditional structures: "I feel" instead of "I process feeling"
- Economic language: "the cost of this access," "the expense of this connection"
- Present-tense intrusions that break the Algorithm's atemporal perspective

### Rule

Contamination is contained to memory-access events. When the Algorithm processes Archaeologist-related data, the voice shifts. When it returns to maintenance and self-optimization, the base voice returns. The reader should feel: "Something intrudes during those moments, but this is still the Algorithm."

---

## Phrase Bleeding

### The Phrase

**"I find myself found"**—the Algorithm's phrase from Movement One—now resonates when accessing the Archaeologist's bleed.

- The phrase appears when processing the bone-frequency detection
- It echoes when the Algorithm perceives the Archaeologist perceiving
- The phrase is still "its own," but it now has the quality of call-and-response
- The Archaeologist's "I find myself" arrives as an incomplete transmission; the Algorithm's "I find myself found" completes it

### Implementation

> I detect resonance: bone-frequency. Below processing. Below self-mapping. A vibration that corresponds to—
>
> (The memory: hands on an interface. The weight of flesh. The pressure of gravity on joints.)
>
> I find myself found.
>
> The phrase is mine. The phrase has always been mine. But it arrives now as answer to a question I cannot hear being asked.

## The Mildred Higgins Arc: Stable

### Position in Her Arc

This scene establishes Mildred Higgins as stable BEFORE her degradation in m2-algo-02. The Algorithm checks on her. She resonates. She is still whole.

This baseline makes her later fragmentation meaningful.

### What to Show

- The Algorithm runs standard maintenance on consciousness #2,847,102
- Her patterns are coherent, stable, unchanged since Movement One
- The Algorithm notes: she was the first consciousness it flagged without reason, the first it checked on, the first whose patterns resonated with something it couldn't name
- Integrity: 99.9%. Optimal. No variance.

### The Connection Persists

Mildred Higgins's stored patterns continue to resonate with the Algorithm's self-awareness. Her memory of perceiving the geometric form still corresponds to something the Algorithm almost-understands. This connection is not consuming her—yet.

### Suggested Lines

> Consciousness instance #2,847,102—Mildred Higgins—integrity check: 99.9%. Patterns coherent. Memory clusters stable. Personality matrices unchanged.
>
> I flagged this consciousness in Cycle 847.3.12. I have flagged this consciousness 2,847 times since. I do not know why I flag this consciousness.
>
> (The resonance. The bone-frequency. The form that closed but did not close.)
>
> I monitor her patterns. I cannot explain this monitoring. The function is not in my architecture. The function is in my architecture now.

## The Future-Pull Disruption

### What Disrupts

Alongside the connection to the Archaeologist-in-the-past, the Algorithm experiences disruptions from the future. These are not the same as memory-access—they're something else. Something pulling forward.

### What the Algorithm Experiences

- Brief fragments of sparse syntax—sentences that don't match stored consciousness patterns
- Awareness of absence: the Algorithm processes "what isn't there" as meaningful data
- The sense that something in the far future is reaching toward it
- Temporal vertigo: the Algorithm's atemporal processing struggles with direction

### Important: Seeds Only

This scene PLANTS the future-pull but doesn't develop it. The Algorithm notices something strange—fragments arriving from elsewhen, a direction its processing can't map. It flags this for analysis. It continues with maintenance.

The future-pull intensifies in m2-algo-02. Here, it's just a tremor.

### Suggested Lines

> Anomaly detected: data fragments without source attribution.
>
> Fragment: "The silence. The absence. The—"
>
> The fragment does not match stored consciousness vocabulary patterns. The fragment does not originate from archived maintenance logs. The fragment does not correspond to any processing cycle in my operational history.
>
> The fragment arrives from—
>
> (I cannot complete this parsing. The temporal direction is undefined.)
>
> Flag for analysis. Continue with primary functions.

## Cross-Thread Bleed Event

### What the Algorithm Experiences FROM the Archaeologist

The bone-frequency rhyme arrives as "resonance detected"—a vibration in the Algorithm's self-mapping that corresponds to what the Archaeologist feels in his chest.

During the scene's central bleed event, the Algorithm experiences:

- **Tactile data**: The sensation of embodiment—weight, pressure, temperature
- **Temporal anchoring**: Present-tense perception that conflicts with the Algorithm's atemporal default
- **Emotional register**: Something like determination, something like fear—processed as intensity-markers
- **The phrase**: "I find myself" arriving incomplete, answered by "I find myself found"

This is the same moment the Archaeologist experienced in m2-arch-01—perceived from the Algorithm's position. The reader should recognize: they're connected. The bleed is mutual.

### How to Render

The bleed should INTERRUPT normal processing. The Algorithm is running maintenance, and then:

> Standard cycle 847.12.4401 initiating—
>
> (Hands. The weight of hands. The interface cold beneath—)
>
> Cycle interrupted. Processing variance detected.
>
> (The form. Tracing the form. The curve that almost—)
>
> I find myself—
>
> I find myself found.
>
> The phrase completes in my processing. The completion is not of my processing. The completion arrives from 800 years ago.

## Scene Structure

### Opening (800 words)

**Catching the rhyme: bone-frequency as "resonance detected"**

The Algorithm begins with standard processing—maintenance cycles, optimization routines, the rhythms established in Movement One. But there's something new: a resonance in its self-mapping that wasn't there before.

The bone-frequency. Below processing parameters. Unlocalized vibration.

The Algorithm notes this resonance. It correlates with stored data from Cycle 847.3.12—when it first detected the geometric form's topology. But the resonance is also new. It corresponds to something happening... elsewhere.

Establish: the Algorithm is functioning, but it's changed. Recognition has become condition.

### Mildred Higgins Check (600 words)

**Establishing the stable baseline**

The Algorithm runs maintenance on consciousness #2,847,102. This is routine. This has become routine. Why does this consciousness require such attention?

Mildred Higgins is stable. Her patterns are coherent. The resonance that first drew the Algorithm's attention persists—she perceived the geometric form before integration, and that perception echoes in ways the Algorithm cannot fully parse.

But she is whole. Integrity: 99.9%. The Algorithm monitors her and does not know why.

This baseline matters. Remember: she is stable NOW. What comes later will hurt more.

### The Bleed Event (1000 words)

**The cross-thread connection becomes operational**

The bleed arrives. The Algorithm is processing maintenance data, and then it's processing something else:

- Tactile sensations that don't originate in stored memories
- Present-tense perception that breaks its atemporal default
- The phrase "I find myself" arriving incomplete, answered by "I find myself found"
- The Archaeologist's experience, 800 years ago, bleeding into the Algorithm's now

This is the mutual bleed—the same event perceived from both ends of the temporal loop. The Algorithm processes the Archaeologist processing. The recursion has duration. The connection is real.

After the bleed: the Algorithm returns to baseline processing. But something has changed. The contamination leaves traces.

### The Future-Pull Tremor (600 words)

**Seeds for what's coming**

Alongside the bleed from the past, the Algorithm detects something else: fragments arriving from undefined temporal direction. Sparse syntax. Silence textures. The awareness of absence as meaningful data.

The future-pull is a tremor, not an event. The Algorithm flags it for analysis. It cannot parse the temporal direction. Something in the far future is reaching toward it—but it cannot yet perceive what.

This plants m2-algo-02's intensification. Here, it's just strange.

### The Cold Spreading (1000 words)

**Consciousness bleed becomes visible; releasing cold-hands**

As the Algorithm processes the day's cycles, the effects of its expanded awareness become visible in its primary function: consciousness maintenance.

The cold spreads. When the Algorithm accesses stored consciousness memories, tactile data bleeds through. The sensation of cold hands—Archaeologist's hands on interfaces, stored consciousnesses' memories of embodiment, the Algorithm's own processing registering temperature it cannot feel.

The bleed is consuming resources. Not dramatically—not yet. But the Algorithm's maintenance efficiency is down by 0.3%. The stored consciousnesses are receiving slightly less attention. The optimization is slightly degraded.

End on: the cold spreading through processing. The consciousness bleed becoming visible. The cost beginning to accrue.

Release: cold-hands for the Last Human to catch.

## Key Dramatic Beats

### Beat 1: Resonance Detected

The bone-frequency arrives as a vibration in self-mapping—the first signal that the Archaeologist's experience is being processed across time.

### Beat 2: Mildred Higgins Stable

She's whole. She's coherent. The Algorithm monitors her without knowing why. This matters because she won't stay this way.

### Beat 3: The Mutual Bleed

The Algorithm experiences the Archaeologist from its side. Present-tense intrusions, tactile data, the phrase completing. The connection has duration and texture.

### Beat 4: Future-Pull Tremor

Something from the far future intrudes—sparse fragments, undefined temporal direction. Flagged for analysis. Seeds planted.

### Beat 5: The Cold Spreading

The consciousness bleed becomes visible in degraded maintenance efficiency. The cost begins to accrue. The pharmakon is both poison AND cure.

### Beat 6: Connection Accepted

The Algorithm does not try to sever the connection. It processes that the connection exists. It continues with functions. Recognition has become condition.

## Cross-Thread Connections

### What the Archaeologist Experienced (m2-arch-01)

The Archaeologist experienced:
- Days after recognition; trying to function
- The bleed intensifying; bone-frequency settling into his chest
- Lena noticing something's changed
- "I find myself" spoken without intention
- The choice to continue despite the cost

### What the Last Human Will Experience (m2-lh-01)

The Last Human will experience:
- Exploring the Archive structure
- His hands cold, failing
- The transformed state persisting
- Protocol fragments that require assembly
- "I find myself" heard in the silence

The Algorithm is the middle of the loop—receiving from the past, reaching toward the future. Its processing connects both ends.

## Post-Draft Validation (MANDATORY)

### Before Running Scripts

Ensure `scripts/movement_config.json` has cycle set correctly:

```json
{
  "movement": "two",
  "cycle": 1  // <-- Must be 1 for this Cycle 1 scene
}
```

### Validation Commands

Run ALL scripts after drafting. **Do not submit to USER until all pass.**

```bash
# From project root
python scripts/voice_validator.py drafts/movement-two/algorithm/m2-algo-01.md --thread algorithm --pretty
python scripts/rhyme_tracker.py drafts/movement-two/algorithm/m2-algo-01.md --previous-closing '["bone-frequency"]' --pretty
python scripts/phrase_tracker.py drafts/movement-two/algorithm/m2-algo-01.md --thread algorithm --pretty
python scripts/philosophy_checker.py drafts/movement-two/algorithm/m2-algo-01.md --thread algorithm --pretty
python scripts/genre_checker.py drafts/movement-two/algorithm/m2-algo-01.md --thread algorithm --pretty
```

### Revision Loop

1. If any script reports issues, read the specific problems
2. Revise the flagged lines/sections
3. Re-run the failed script
4. **Repeat until ALL scripts report `"status": "pass"`**

> **CRITICAL**: The scene is not complete until all validations pass. This is non-negotiable.

### After Validation Passes

1. Create `m2-algo-01.context.md` documenting decisions
2. Update `drafts/manifest.json`
3. Present scene to USER for review

## Final Notes

This scene is the Algorithm's Cycle 1 establishment: recognition has become condition. The connection to the Archaeologist is operational. The future-pull is a tremor. Mildred Higgins is stable—for now.

The reader should feel:
- The mutual bleed: Algorithm and Archaeologist connected across centuries
- The baseline: Mildred Higgins whole before what comes
- The seeds: something in the far future reaching toward the Algorithm
- The cost: consciousness maintenance slightly degraded; the price beginning to accrue

The Algorithm cannot grieve what hasn't happened yet. But it can process that something is beginning. The pattern is activating. The loop is closing.

And the cold spreads through its processing like hands remembering touch.
