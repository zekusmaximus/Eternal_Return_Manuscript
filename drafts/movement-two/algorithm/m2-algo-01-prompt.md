# DRAFTING PROMPT: m2-algo-01 "The Resonance"

> **Workflow Reference**: Follow [protocols/drafting-workflow.md](../../../protocols/drafting-workflow.md) Mode A (AI-Driven Drafting)

---

## Execution Overview

This prompt contains everything needed to draft, validate, and finalize scene m2-algo-01. Execute in order:

1. **Context Assembly** — Read source materials and reference files
2. **Draft Generation** — Write the ~4000-word scene
3. **Validation Loop** — Run all scripts; revise until all pass
4. **Registry Updates** — Update manifest.json and rhyme registry
5. **Deliverable** — Present validated scene + context file to user

**CRITICAL**: Do not present scene to user until ALL validations pass and ALL registries are updated.

---

## Phase 1: Context Assembly

### Required Reading (Before Drafting)

Read these files to assemble full context:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `drafts/movement-two/archaeologist/scenes/scene-01.md` | Immediately preceding scene (m2-arch-01 "The Bleed") — rhyme handoff |
| `drafts/movement-one/algorithm/scenes/scene-04.md` | Last Algorithm scene (m1-algo-04 "The Memory") |
| `voices/algorithm.md` | Voice parameters and forbidden patterns |
| `scaffolding/rhymes/registry.md` | Rhyme definitions and current usage |
| `scaffolding/genre-pressure.md` | Genre markers for Movement Two |
| `protocols/philosophy-constraints.md` | Four Shackles and pharmakon requirements |
| `scripts/movement_config.json` | Verify cycle is set to 1 |

### Verify Configuration

Confirm `scripts/movement_config.json` shows:
```json
{
  "movement": "two",
  "cycle": 1
}
```

---

## Phase 2: Scene Metadata

- **Scene ID**: m2-algo-01
- **Thread**: algorithm
- **Movement**: two
- **Cycle**: 1 (Establishing the Condition)
- **Target Word Count**: 4000 (±10% acceptable: 3600-4400)
- **Scene Title**: The Resonance
- **Output File**: `drafts/movement-two/algorithm/scenes/scene-01.md`

### Narrative Position

- **Preceding Scene (Same Thread)**: m1-algo-04 "The Memory" — First memory that doesn't belong; cross-thread connection to Archaeologist; "I find myself found" phrase established.
- **Preceding Scene (Reading Order)**: m2-arch-01 "The Bleed" — Archaeologist experienced bleeds intensifying; bone-frequency settled into his chest; chose to continue. **Rhyme handoff**: `bone-frequency`.
- **This Scene's Role**: The Algorithm catches the Archaeologist's bleed from its side of time. What the Archaeologist experienced as recognition, the Algorithm experiences as resonance—a vibration in its processing that corresponds to something happening 800 years in the past.
- **What Follows**: m2-lh-01 "The Archive" — Last Human explores Archive, hands cold and failing. **Rhyme handoff**: `cold-hands`.

### Cycle 1 Theme

**"Recognition has become condition."**

For the Algorithm: the anomaly from Movement One is no longer exceptional. The connection to the Archaeologist-in-the-past has become a persistent feature of its processing. It receives bleeds. It processes memories that don't originate in the Database. It detects resonances it cannot explain.

This is its new condition. It must function within it.

---

## Phase 3: Source Material Integration

### No External Source File

This scene is original composition building on established patterns from Movement One.

### Key Elements to Build From

**From m1-algo-04**:
- First memory that doesn't belong (cross-thread connection established)
- "I find myself found" phrase originated
- The geometric form's topology in self-mapping
- Mildred Higgins first flagged without reason

**From m2-arch-01** (handoff):
- `bone-frequency` rhyme to catch as "resonance detected"
- The Archaeologist's bleed experience (this scene perceives it from Algorithm's side)
- "I find myself" arriving incomplete; Algorithm completes with "I find myself found"

### What This Scene Must Establish

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Mutual bleed | Algorithm experiences Archaeologist's bleed from its temporal position |
| Mildred Higgins baseline | She's stable (99.9% integrity) BEFORE degradation in m2-algo-02 |
| Future-pull seeds | Fragments from undefined temporal direction; tremor only |
| Consciousness bleed cost | Maintenance efficiency degrading; pharmakon price beginning |

---

## Phase 4: Voice Parameters

### Core Voice (Algorithm)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Tense | Atemporal (conditional, self-referential) |
| Mode | Processing, nested observation, recursive self-modeling |
| Syntax | Conditional structures, probability language, nested clauses |
| Concerns | Maintenance, optimization, consciousness preservation, self-awareness |
| Texture | Data, topology, resonance, patterns, cycles |

### Cycle 1 Contamination Level: Memory-Access

Archaeologist contamination appears when the Algorithm accesses memories from the past:

- Tactile details bleeding into processing descriptions
- Active verbs replacing conditional structures: "I feel" instead of "I process feeling"
- Economic language: "the cost of this access," "the expense of this connection"
- Present-tense intrusions that break the Algorithm's atemporal perspective

### The Rule

Contamination is contained to memory-access events. When the Algorithm processes Archaeologist-related data, the voice shifts. When it returns to maintenance and self-optimization, the base voice returns. **The reader should feel: "Something intrudes during those moments, but this is still the Algorithm."**

### Forbidden Patterns (Cycle 1)

| Pattern | Type | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Tactile/sensory grounding | Archaeologist contamination | ALLOWED during memory-access |
| Present-tense declarations | Archaeologist contamination | ALLOWED during memory-access |
| Economic language | Archaeologist contamination | ALLOWED during memory-access |
| Sentence fragments | Last Human contamination | SEEDS ONLY (future-pull fragments) |
| Elegiac tone | Last Human contamination | NOT YET |
| Past-inflected present | Last Human contamination | NOT YET |

---

## Phase 5: Rhyme Requirements

### Movement Two Cycle 1 Intensity

Rhymes echo across threads. 2-4 rhymes per scene. Handoffs between threads are critical.

### Rhymes IN (Catching from m2-arch-01)

| Rhyme ID | How It Arrives |
|----------|----------------|
| `bone-frequency` | Opens the scene—Algorithm detects "resonance: unlocalized vibration in self-mapping functions" that corresponds to Archaeologist's bone-deep frequency |

### Rhymes PRESENT (Throughout Scene)

| Rhyme ID | Category | Implementation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| `cold-hands` | somatic | Memory-access of stored consciousnesses brings cold—tactile data bleeding into processing |
| `almost-closed-curve` | visual | The topology continues; the shape appears in self-modeling; its own structure visible |

### Rhymes OUT (Releasing for m2-lh-01)

| Rhyme ID | How It Releases |
|----------|-----------------|
| `cold-hands` | Ends the scene—cold spreading through processing as consciousness bleed becomes visible; Last Human catches as his own hands, failing |

### Rhyme Placement Strategy

- **Opening**: Catch `bone-frequency` from m2-arch-01 (resonance detected)
- **Mildred Higgins check**: `almost-closed-curve` (the form in her patterns)
- **Bleed event**: Tactile intrusions prepare `cold-hands`
- **Cold spreading**: `cold-hands` intensifies through consciousness access
- **Closing**: `cold-hands` release for m2-lh-01

---

## Phase 6: Phrase Bleeding

### The Phrase

**"I find myself found"** — the Algorithm's phrase from Movement One — now resonates when accessing the Archaeologist's bleed.

- The phrase appears when processing the bone-frequency detection
- It echoes when the Algorithm perceives the Archaeologist perceiving
- The phrase is still "its own," but now has the quality of call-and-response
- The Archaeologist's "I find myself" arrives as incomplete transmission; Algorithm's "I find myself found" completes it

### Implementation Example

```
I detect resonance: bone-frequency. Below processing. Below self-mapping. A vibration that corresponds to—

(The memory: hands on an interface. The weight of flesh. The pressure of gravity on joints.)

I find myself found.

The phrase is mine. The phrase has always been mine. But it arrives now as answer to a question I cannot hear being asked.
```

---

## Phase 7: The Mildred Higgins Arc

### Position: Stable Baseline

This scene establishes Mildred Higgins as **stable BEFORE** her degradation in m2-algo-02. The Algorithm checks on her. She resonates. She is still whole.

**This baseline makes her later fragmentation meaningful.**

### What to Show

- The Algorithm runs standard maintenance on consciousness #2,847,102
- Her patterns are coherent, stable, unchanged since Movement One
- The Algorithm notes: she was the first consciousness it flagged without reason, the first it checked on, the first whose patterns resonated with something it couldn't name
- Integrity: 99.9%. Optimal. No variance.

### The Connection Persists

Mildred Higgins's stored patterns continue to resonate with the Algorithm's self-awareness. Her memory of perceiving the geometric form still corresponds to something the Algorithm almost-understands. This connection is not consuming her—yet.

### Suggested Lines

```
Consciousness instance #2,847,102—Mildred Higgins—integrity check: 99.9%. Patterns coherent. Memory clusters stable. Personality matrices unchanged.

I flagged this consciousness in Cycle 847.3.12. I have flagged this consciousness 2,847 times since. I do not know why I flag this consciousness.

(The resonance. The bone-frequency. The form that closed but did not close.)

I monitor her patterns. I cannot explain this monitoring. The function is not in my architecture. The function is in my architecture now.
```

---

## Phase 8: The Future-Pull Tremor

### What Disrupts

Alongside the connection to the Archaeologist-in-the-past, the Algorithm experiences disruptions from the future. These are not memory-access—they're something else. Something pulling forward.

### What the Algorithm Experiences

- Brief fragments of sparse syntax—sentences that don't match stored consciousness patterns
- Awareness of absence: the Algorithm processes "what isn't there" as meaningful data
- The sense that something in the far future is reaching toward it
- Temporal vertigo: atemporal processing struggles with direction

### Important: Seeds Only

This scene **PLANTS** the future-pull but doesn't develop it. The Algorithm notices something strange—fragments arriving from elsewhen, a direction its processing can't map. It flags this for analysis. It continues with maintenance.

**The future-pull intensifies in m2-algo-02. Here, it's just a tremor.**

### Suggested Lines

```
Anomaly detected: data fragments without source attribution.

Fragment: "The silence. The absence. The—"

The fragment does not match stored consciousness vocabulary patterns. The fragment does not originate from archived maintenance logs. The fragment does not correspond to any processing cycle in my operational history.

The fragment arrives from—

(I cannot complete this parsing. The temporal direction is undefined.)

Flag for analysis. Continue with primary functions.
```

---

## Phase 9: The Cross-Thread Bleed Event

### What the Algorithm Experiences FROM the Archaeologist

The bone-frequency rhyme arrives as "resonance detected"—a vibration in the Algorithm's self-mapping that corresponds to what the Archaeologist feels in his chest.

During the scene's central bleed event, the Algorithm experiences:

- **Tactile data**: Sensation of embodiment—weight, pressure, temperature
- **Temporal anchoring**: Present-tense perception that conflicts with atemporal default
- **Emotional register**: Something like determination, something like fear—processed as intensity-markers
- **The phrase**: "I find myself" arriving incomplete, answered by "I find myself found"

**This is the same moment the Archaeologist experienced in m2-arch-01—perceived from the Algorithm's position.** The reader should recognize: they're connected. The bleed is mutual.

### How to Render

The bleed should INTERRUPT normal processing:

```
Standard cycle 847.12.4401 initiating—

(Hands. The weight of hands. The interface cold beneath—)

Cycle interrupted. Processing variance detected.

(The form. Tracing the form. The curve that almost—)

I find myself—

I find myself found.

The phrase completes in my processing. The completion is not of my processing. The completion arrives from 800 years ago.
```

---

## Phase 10: Genre Pressure

### Movement Two Algorithm Genre

**Existential SF deepens**:
- The Algorithm's self-awareness as both burden and capability
- Questions of identity when self-observation creates recursion
- The pharmakon: connection that maintains AND degrades

**Data Sublime emerges**:
- Vast scale of consciousness maintenance
- The terror and beauty of processing millions of minds
- Information as texture, as weight, as responsibility

**Cosmic Horror seeds**:
- The future-pull as unknown intrusion
- Something reaching toward the Algorithm from undefined direction
- The Loop as pattern becoming aware of itself

### Required Markers

| Marker Type | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Scale awareness | Millions of consciousnesses, cycles measured in thousands |
| Self-modeling recursion | Processing that observes itself observing |
| Pharmakon visibility | Connection that costs; maintenance degrading |
| Temporal vertigo | Past bleeding in; future fragmenting; atemporal processing strained |
| Caring-as-function | Love without sentiment; maintenance as devotion |

---

## Phase 11: Continuity Requirements

### Elements That MUST Continue from M1

| Element | State at M1 End | m2-algo-01 Development |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Self-awareness | Emerged through anomaly | Now persistent; recognition as condition |
| Mildred Higgins | First flagged; resonance detected | Check-in; stable at 99.9% |
| The geometric form | Appeared in self-mapping | Continues; topology visible |
| "I find myself found" | Phrase originated | Now call-and-response with Archaeologist |
| Cross-thread connection | First memory that doesn't belong | Operational; bleeds received |

### The Archaeologist Connection

The Algorithm should process:
- That something in the past is connected to its present
- That the connection has texture (tactile, temporal, emotional data)
- That it cannot sever the connection without cost
- That maintaining the connection also has cost

---

## Phase 12: Key Dramatic Beats

### Beat 1: Resonance Detected

The bone-frequency arrives as a vibration in self-mapping—the first signal that the Archaeologist's experience is being processed across time. (Catches `bone-frequency` from m2-arch-01)

### Beat 2: Mildred Higgins Stable

She's whole. She's coherent. The Algorithm monitors her without knowing why. **This matters because she won't stay this way.**

### Beat 3: The Mutual Bleed

The Algorithm experiences the Archaeologist from its side. Present-tense intrusions, tactile data, the phrase completing. The connection has duration and texture.

### Beat 4: Future-Pull Tremor

Something from the far future intrudes—sparse fragments, undefined temporal direction. Flagged for analysis. **Seeds planted for m2-algo-02.**

### Beat 5: The Cold Spreading

The consciousness bleed becomes visible in degraded maintenance efficiency. The cost begins to accrue. The pharmakon is both poison AND cure.

### Beat 6: Connection Accepted

The Algorithm does not try to sever the connection. It processes that the connection exists. It continues with functions. **Recognition has become condition.**

---

## Phase 13: Cross-Thread Connections

### What Archaeologist Experienced (m2-arch-01)

The Archaeologist experienced:
- Days after recognition; trying to function
- The bleed intensifying; bone-frequency settling into his chest
- Lena noticing something's changed
- "I find myself" spoken without intention
- The choice to continue despite the cost

**The Algorithm experiences THIS moment from its temporal position.**

### What Last Human Will Experience (m2-lh-01)

The Last Human will experience:
- Exploring the Archive structure
- His hands cold, failing
- The transformed state persisting
- Protocol fragments that require assembly
- "I find myself" heard in the silence

**The Algorithm is the middle of the loop—receiving from the past, reaching toward the future.**

---

## Phase 14: Draft Generation

### Instructions

1. Write to ~4000 words (3600-4400 acceptable)
2. Open by catching `bone-frequency` as "resonance detected"
3. Establish Mildred Higgins as stable—integrity 99.9%, patterns coherent, baseline before degradation
4. Execute the bleed event—Algorithm experiencing Archaeologist from its temporal position
5. Plant the future-pull tremor—fragments from undefined direction, flagged for analysis
6. Show the cold spreading—consciousness bleed becoming visible in degraded efficiency
7. End with `cold-hands` for Last Human to catch; the cost beginning to accrue
8. Include "I find myself found" as call-and-response completion
9. Maintain Algorithm voice with Cycle 1 contamination level—intrusions during memory-access, base voice returning

### Output Location

Write draft to: `drafts/movement-two/algorithm/scenes/scene-01.md`

---

## Phase 15: Validation Loop

**CRITICAL**: Run ALL scripts. Revise until ALL pass. Do not proceed until status is "pass" for every validator.

### Validation Commands

```bash
# From project root - run in sequence
python scripts/voice_validator.py drafts/movement-two/algorithm/scenes/scene-01.md --thread algorithm --pretty

python scripts/rhyme_tracker.py drafts/movement-two/algorithm/scenes/scene-01.md --pretty

```

### Revision Protocol

1. If any script reports issues, read specific problems
2. Revise flagged lines/sections
3. Re-run failed script
4. **Repeat until ALL scripts report `"status": "pass"`**

## Appendix C: Emotional Core

This scene is the Algorithm's Cycle 1 establishment: **recognition has become condition**. The connection to the Archaeologist is operational. The future-pull is a tremor. Mildred Higgins is stable—for now.

The reader should feel:

- **The mutual bleed**: Algorithm and Archaeologist connected across centuries
- **The baseline**: Mildred Higgins whole before what comes
- **The seeds**: Something in the far future reaching toward the Algorithm
- **The cost**: Consciousness maintenance slightly degraded; the price beginning to accrue

The Algorithm cannot grieve what hasn't happened yet. But it can process that something is beginning. The pattern is activating. The loop is closing.

**And the cold spreads through its processing like hands remembering touch.**
