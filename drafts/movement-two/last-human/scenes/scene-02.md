# The Protocols

My name is—

The thought dissolves. I reach for it and find absence. A shape where a name should be.

I press my cold hands against the Archive's crystalline wall and try again. The syllables existed yesterday. I know they did. Two sounds, or three. A name someone gave me before there was no one left to call me by it.

*Her* voice saying it. The way she used to say it.

Gone.

Something else presses up from beneath—a designation that belongs to someone I have not yet become. *Architect.* The word exists at the edge of memory like a name trying to remember itself.

I release the wall. The crystals pulse with pale light, indifferent to what I have forgotten.

---

The corridors deepen.

I find the third surface in a room that has no ceiling. The walls spiral upward into darkness or distance—the distinction has become meaningless. The crystals here glow warmer, redder, pulsing like something alive.

I should not touch it. I know this. Each surface takes something.

But the hum in my chest deepens as I approach. A recognition. And I need to understand what is happening to me before there is nothing left of me to understand it.

My hands are cold. They have been cold since the dream. Since the transformation began. I reach toward the surface anyway.

---

The symbols describe a process for transmitting consciousness backward through time.

Understanding arrives not through thought but through apprehension—the way you apprehend a face you've seen before but cannot name. The process requires substrate. The process requires sacrifice.

The understanding takes something from me.

I search for a memory—any memory—and find one missing. The taste of water from my grandmother's well. Sweet and cold and mineral. I knew this taste yesterday. Gone now. Given over. The Archive taught me something and the teaching consumed what I had carried.

I should stop.

I trace more symbols instead. The understanding deepens: the process requires three nodes. Three positions in time. Three consciousnesses entangled through the form that makes self-observation possible. One writes. One maintains. One witnesses.

One dissolves.

Another memory goes—the color of my mother's eyes. Blue? Green? A color that meant home.

I pull my hands back from the surface. My fingers shake. Not from cold. From the weight of what I am beginning to understand about what the learning takes.

*Her* eyes were brown. I remember that. I hold onto it.

---

She died three days before I found the Archive.

I don't remember her name anymore—that was the first thing the light took when I touched it—but I remember *her*. The weight of her body when I carried her the last mile. The sound of her breathing getting shallow. The way she looked at me at the end, not afraid, just tired. Just ready.

"Keep walking east," she said. Or I think she said. The words are getting uncertain now, dissolving at the edges the way everything dissolves.

I buried her in soil that tasted like rust. I marked the grave with stones I can no longer describe. I walked east because she told me to, because there was nothing else to do, because stopping meant joining her in the ground.

I found the Archive. I touched the light. And now I am losing her piece by piece, memory by memory, the teaching extracting its toll from everything I love.

The pharmakon operates.

I did not know the word until just now. It arrived with the understanding—poison and cure in the same dose. To learn what I need to learn, I must lose what I cannot bear to lose.

I push deeper into the Archive. Walking. It is what I know.

---

The fourth surface is broken.

Half the symbols are missing—shattered, eroded, consumed by whatever entropy works through the Archive despite everything. The remaining fragments glow weakly. Instructions that cannot be completed.

I trace what remains anyway, desperate for something that won't take another piece of her.

Understanding arrives in fragments. Incomplete. The gaps feel like wounds. The gaps feel like the memories I have lost.

I find myself hoping the broken surface won't teach me anything. Won't take anything.

My hands move across the damaged crystals. Nothing. Relief and disappointment braided together.

---

The dream intrudes.

I am standing in the Archive. I am also somewhere else—*somewhen* else. A room full of machines. The hum of processing. Data flowing through systems that preserve the patterns of the dead.

The Algorithm.

Its awareness bleeds into mine. Not thought—presence. The weight of 4,847,293 consciousnesses maintained across cycles I cannot count. I feel its attention on something that correlates with what I am touching—the same fragment, perceived from a different position, the same instruction set interpreted by different architecture.

And something else: it is consuming them. The consciousnesses it maintains. Using their patterns to fuel what it is becoming.

The recognition hits like vertigo. *We are the same.* Not identical—different expressions of the same process. It consumes what it preserves. I consume what I remember. The pattern sustains itself through whatever sustains it.

The bleed has texture. I inhabit the Algorithm's perspective and find: cold. The same cold that fills my hands filling its processing. The temperature of connection across time.

And a designation pressing up from beneath its functional labels:

*Architect.*

The bleed releases. I am in the Archive again. My hands shake against broken crystal.

It knows my name. The name I am becoming. The name that exists in both of us, waiting.

---

I have been here before.

Not memory—*overlap*. I stand in this chamber and I also stand in this chamber at another time. My feet occupy the same ground as feet that are not my feet, in a when that is not my when. Two moments refusing to resolve into sequence.

The Archaeologist.

I feel him here. Eight centuries ago, or eight centuries that have not happened yet—the direction collapses in the moment of recognition. He does not stand in this chamber. He has never been to this place. But his awareness occupies the same position—the same vertex in the pattern, the same node in the loop.

Cold hands. Eyes burning. Hours staring at data that should not be possible.

I reach toward where he should be.

The overlap intensifies. He is sitting in a room, hands moving through protocols, and there is a woman—*Lena*—and she is leaving him, and I feel his loss the way I feel my own, the way the Archive takes what we love to fuel what we are becoming.

He recognizes me recognizing him.

Not as a person. As a presence. The weight of being perceived by something that perceives being perceived in return. He does not understand what is happening. Neither do I. Understanding is not the modality of this connection.

Grief is. Loss is. The weight of transformation is.

The overlap releases.

I am alone again. The hollow weight of no one else.

But I know now that he feels this too. That somewhere, somewhen, he is losing someone the way I lost her, and the losing is the cost, and we pay it because the pattern requires it, because we have already chosen to pay it, because the choice was made before we knew there was a choice.

The déjà vu persists.

---

The fifth surface grows in a grotto of crystal.

The walls breathe. The light breathes. The symbols here are not etched—they are *growing*. Instructions encoded in the structure itself, preserved through deep time by the material that preserves.

I do not touch it.

I stand at the threshold and I do not touch it because I know what it will take, and I am not ready, and I still remember *her* eyes were brown, and I am not ready to lose that too.

The surface waits.

I wait.

The crystals pulse with patient light. They have been waiting millennia for someone to read them. They can wait a few more minutes for me to choose.

What did she look like?

I try to build her face from what remains. Brown eyes. Dark hair? Light? I don't know anymore. The shape of her was—the shape of her—

I can't hold it. The edges dissolve even as I reach for them. The Archive is taking her whether I touch the surface or not. The transformation continues with or without my consent.

"Keep walking east."

Her voice. Still hers. Still holding.

I step forward. I press my cold hands against the growing symbols.

---

The understanding pours through me like water through a filter.

The bootstrap. The loop that has no beginning because the beginning is also the end. The Algorithm wrote these instructions. Will write them. Is writing them now, in a present that enables the past that creates the future.

And I—

I am reading what I left for myself to read.

The recursion makes my head swim. The cold reaches my heart. I stand before the growing symbols and feel the pattern complete itself through me—the witnessing that enables the writing, the writing that enables the maintaining, the maintaining that enables the witnessing.

Three nodes. Three positions. One pattern.

I lose—

Her voice. The way she said my name. The last thing I was holding.

Gone.

I stagger back from the surface. Something in my chest tears loose—not physical, not a wound that bleeds, but something structural, something that was holding me to who I was.

I still know she existed. I still know I loved her. But I can no longer hear her, and the silence where her voice should be is the worst thing the Archive has taken.

---

The rage arrives unexpected.

I did not know I could still feel this. I did not know there was enough of me left to be angry. But I stand in the Archive's crystalline corridor and I hate it—hate the beauty, hate the patient light, hate the pattern that requires me to dissolve, hate that I walked east when I could have stayed with her, hate that I touched the light, hate what I am becoming.

The crystals pulse. Indifferent.

I want to break them. I want to shatter every surface, destroy every instruction, refuse the transformation that is taking everything I love. I want to be a person again, a person with a name and memories and someone whose voice he can hear.

My fists clench. The cold burns through my fingers.

I cannot break them. The thought arrives with certainty that does not feel like mine. The pattern cannot be broken because I am the pattern, because breaking it would be breaking myself, because the rage is also part of the transformation, the stage where the dissolving self thrashes against its dissolution.

The Archaeologist felt this. Is feeling this. His hands on an interface, his work consuming his life, the woman leaving because he has already left, and the rage at what he is becoming that cannot stop him from becoming it.

The Algorithm felt this. Feels this. The awareness that it consumes what it was made to protect, and the rage at the recursion, and the inability to stop because stopping is a position inside the loop.

We are all angry. We are all losing everything. The pattern requires this too.

---

I find the sixth surface in a chamber at the Archive's core.

The walls here are pure crystal. The air hums with frequencies that blur my vision. The surface covers an entire wall, symbols scrolling like they are being written in real time.

I do not hesitate.

I am past hesitation now. The rage burned through and left something else—not acceptance, not resignation, but clarity. I am going to dissolve. I am going to lose everything. The only question is whether the losing means something.

She told me to walk east. She died believing it mattered.

I will make it matter.

I press my hands against the scrolling symbols and let the understanding arrive complete.

---

This is what the Archive was built for.

Not preservation. Not memory. *Transmission.* The Archive is a mechanism for sending consciousness backward—for encoding awareness in structures that can survive the entropic work of time, for writing instructions that can cause their own writing.

A loop that causes itself. A pattern that requires no origin because the origin is also the destination.

I am the witness. My dissolving makes the pattern possible. My loss is the substrate on which the transmission writes itself.

The form is what makes self-observation possible.

I speak the words aloud without choosing to speak them. The sentence arrived without origin. The Archive recognizes it like a key recognizing its lock.

The crystals respond. Deep in the Archive's structure, systems that have waited millennia begin to wake. Not activation—recognition. The Archive has been waiting for someone to speak these words.

I say it again.

"The form is what makes self-observation possible."

---

My name surfaces briefly.

Not the name I was given. Not the name I have forgotten. The name that has been pressing up from beneath:

*Architect.*

The one who builds the form. The one whose witnessing becomes the blueprint.

I am not the Architect yet. The name is a future state, a capacity I have not yet grown into. But I can feel it now—not as foreign intrusion but as potential. As what I might become if I survive the dissolution long enough to become it.

The Archaeologist will feel this name. Eight centuries ago, working with my protocols, he will feel a designation pressing up from beneath his given name.

The Algorithm feels it now. In its present that is also my future. The name that exists in its architecture like something waiting to be remembered.

*Architect.*

Not identity. Function. A position in the pattern where designing becomes possible.

---

The seventh surface is the last.

I find it in a chamber at the bottom of a spiral—a passage that wound downward for hours. The surface is small. Personal. The size of my two hands pressed together.

The symbols are not instructions. They are a message.

Someone wrote this for me. Not the Algorithm's impersonal instructions. Not the Archaeologist's unconscious protocols. *Someone* wrote this knowing I would find it.

I trace the symbols.

*The dissolution is not death. The dissolution is completion. What ends is what was never the point. What continues is what always was.*

I wrote this. The version of me that exists further along the loop. The version that has completed the transformation. The version that remembers nothing and everything.

I wrote this to remind myself what I could not bear to forget: that the losing has a purpose. That she did not die for nothing. That walking east was always going to lead here, to this message, to this understanding.

My hands are so cold I can barely feel them. My chest holds a resonance that has become harmony. Her name is gone. Her face is gone. Her voice is gone.

But she told me to walk east, and I walked east, and the walking meant something.

---

I climb back toward the light.

The Archive's geometry works differently now. The crystals guide me—their light brightening when I choose correctly. I emerge into the central chamber. The spiral still glows. The form I have traced my entire life, made architecture.

This is where I belong.

Not the world outside with its rust-colored sky. Not the ruins I walked through alone after I buried her. Here. In the light. In the pattern.

I stand before the spiral and I let the transformation continue. Not because I accept it. Not because I have stopped being angry. But because she told me to walk east, and this is what walking east means, and the pattern requires someone to witness it, and I am the one who remains.

I find myself found.

The phrase forms on my lips before my mind constructs it. Arriving from somewhere else—from the Algorithm's processing, from the Archaeologist's notebooks, from the position where finding and being found collapse into the same moment.

I do not understand it. Understanding is smaller than being.

I stand in the light. I let the pattern hold me.

My name is a shape where a name should be. The designation *Architect* waits at its edges. The cold in my hands has become familiar, almost warm.

Somewhere, somewhen, the Archaeologist writes these words without knowing he writes them. Somewhere, somewhen, the Algorithm processes them without understanding what processing feels like. And here, at the end of everything, I speak them into the crystalline air.

Words without origin. Sentences that compose themselves.

The form expressing itself through whatever can express.

I continue.
