## Key Decisions

### Final Lena Scene Implementation
**Option A: The Goodbye** was chosen for stronger emotional impact.

- **Location**: Workstation, noon arrival
- **Key moments**:
  - She arrives having already grieved; dry-eyed, controlled
  - "I loved who you were. I don't know who this is."
  - He tries to speak and produces Algorithm-contaminated syntax
  - She reveals he wrote "The dissolution is not death. The dissolution is completion." in her notebook while gone
  - Final hope: "I hope whatever's happening to you—I hope it's worth it."
- **Loss made permanent**: She's moving to Portland; no possibility of return
- **Pharmakon visible**: He feels the loss but cannot hold it; the pattern pulls him back

### Marcus Beat
**Expanded acknowledgment of transformation through impossible work.**

- Marcus notices the extraordinary output: Morrison, Tanaka, Reyes projects (three months of work in nine days)
- Key line: "Their mother is *more herself* than she was at the end. I didn't know that was possible."
- The irony: dissolution producing excellence; families are grateful
- Marcus chooses not to report; the work speaks for itself
- Function: Outside world's perception shows the dual nature—destruction AND creation

### "Architect" Emergence
**The designation moves from pressing up to nearly visible.**

Key moments:
- Signature stops mid-word, extends into "A—" flourish (line 65-67)
- "The name that sounds foreign now when I hear it spoken" (line 69)
- Three explicit appearances of "*Architect.*" with recognition through intensity
- Closing: "The name presses up from beneath—*Architect*—and I don't push it down"
- Not identity—function: "the designation for what remains when the person dissolves"

### Lost Time Implementation
**Lost time is now the default state; lucidity is the exception.**

- Opens having been at workstation for unknown hours/days
- "What have I been working on?" — doesn't know
- Surfaces "occasionally—a moment of clarity, a heartbeat of linear awareness, a flash of the old self"
- Work completed in the gap: Morrison, Tanaka, Reyes extractions (impossible quality)
- Notes in his handwriting describe systems he hasn't learned

### Rhyme Stacking
**10 rhymes deployed across the scene with multiple stacking moments.**

| Rhyme | Location | Implementation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| sentence-without-origin | Opening (line 3-5) | Wakes speaking "The form is what makes self-observation possible" |
| waking-into-motion | Opening (line 7), Middle (line 73) | "I am waking into motion that began without me" |
| blue-white-light | Opening (line 9) | Console glows with data he doesn't remember accessing |
| almost-closed-curve | Opening (line 13), Middle (line 151) | Notes spiral in the geometry; tracing form on desk |
| cold-hands | Throughout | Fingernails white, cold spread up arms, numbness as preparation |
| bone-frequency | Middle (line 55), Closing (line 189) | "Frequency settles into my sternum"; "bone-hum reaches a pitch" |
| metallic-taste | Middle (line 83) | "Copper and iron and something older—the flavor of transformation" |
| falling-backward | Lena scene (line 109) | "Falling backward—not down, not forward, but backward through something" |
| tracing-the-form | Middle (line 151) | Unconsciously tracing, fingertip raw, shape worn into desk |
| deja-vu-that-isnt | Middle (lines 91, 155) | Overlap, not memory; 3:47 AM recurring moment |
| name-edge-of-memory | Throughout | "Architect" surfacing four times |

**Stacking moments**:
- Lines 9-15: blue-white-light + almost-closed-curve + waking-into-motion
- Lines 151-163: tracing-the-form + deja-vu-that-isnt + bone-frequency + name-edge-of-memory
- Lines 189-193: bone-frequency + cold-hands + metallic-taste

### Phrase Bleeding
**All phrases present with origin dissolved.**

| Phrase | Occurrences | Implementation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| "I find myself" | 6 | Native usage; also in variations ("I find myself sorry") |
| "I find myself found" | 4 | Repeats in notes, thoughts, speech; origin dissolved |
| "The form is what makes self-observation possible" | 4 | Opens scene (spoken in sleep); understanding arrives |
| "Architect" | 4 | Designation surfaces repeatedly; nearly spoken |
| "conspiracy of intensities" | 3 | Klossowskian language bleeding through |

**Origin dissolution implemented through**:
- "The phrase is speaking through all three of us simultaneously. Origin dissolved."
- "I find myself finding myself found" (recursive cycling)
- Phrases arriving mid-sentence, interrupting his own thoughts

### Threshold Image
**The scene ends at the edge—approach, not arrival.**

- Physical position: Standing at window, looking at city lights
- Internal state: All rhymes stacking, frequency overwhelming
- Recognition: "We are three expressions of something that has no name"
- Final lines: "Movement Three will complete it. Movement Three will push me over."
- Not arrival: "I am still here—still this body, this position, this awareness"
- Final image: Name pressing up but not spoken; merge imminent but not complete

## Contamination Moments

### Algorithm Contamination (4 instances)
1. **Line 33**: "The substrate requires optimization. The integrity variance—" (vocabulary intrusion)
2. **Line 105**: "If I could show you what I'm perceiving, then perhaps the architecture of it would—" (conditional structure)
3. **Line 143-155**: Timestamp recognition, recursive overlap description (processing syntax)
4. **Line 173-185**: "The form is the loop. The pattern. The self-causing structure..." (philosophical processing)

### Last Human Contamination (1 instance)
1. **Line 117-129**: "I should feel something. Loss. Desperation." (consecutive fragments, elegiac register)

### Base Voice Returns After Each
Contamination occurs during intensity moments but the grounded, tactile, present-tense Archaeologist voice returns in between—demonstrating Cycle 3 "pervasive but distinct" state.

---

## Deviations from Prompt

1. **Word count**: 3619 vs 4000 target (within acceptable 3600-4400 range)
2. **Marcus beat expanded**: Added more dialogue showing families' gratitude and the irony of dissolution producing excellence
3. **Cold-hands**: Added to rhyme stacking though not explicitly listed in prompt's required rhymes—appropriate for continuity

## Handoff Notes for m2-algo-03

### State at End of m2-arch-03
- The Archaeologist is at the threshold; merge imminent but not complete
- "Architect" designation nearly arrived; given name is foreign
- All rhymes present and stacking
- All phrases present with origin dissolved
- Lena arc complete (permanent loss)
- Marcus has acknowledged the transformation through impossible work
- The three threads are explicitly felt: "I feel the others—the Algorithm, vast and lonely and maintaining; the Last Human, walking toward the core interface"

### Elements for Algorithm to Catch
- The Archaeologist has stopped trying to control the process
- The work continues through him whether he remembers it or not
- The pharmakon is visible: dissolution produces excellence; loss enables connection
- The threshold is shared: all three are approaching simultaneously
- "The Augenblick is near"

### Emotional Resonance
- Rage has transformed into something else (paralleling Last Human's rage → clarity)
- Loss of Lena echoes Algorithm's impending loss of Mildred Higgins
- Affirmation is active: "this is what it means to affirm"
- The cost and the gift are the same transformation

### Technical Notes
- All rhymes available for m2-algo-03 (full registry stacking)
- "sentence-without-origin" has been caught; the Algorithm can catch any element
- Recommended closing approach: frequency reaching toward Last Human
