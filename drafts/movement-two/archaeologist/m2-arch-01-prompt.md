# DRAFTING CONTEXT FOR: m2-arch-01 "The Bleed"

## Scene Metadata

- **Scene ID**: m2-arch-01
- **Thread**: archaeologist
- **Movement**: two
- **Target Word Count**: 4000
- **Scene Title**: The Bleed
- **Scene Notes**: First scene of Movement Two; entanglement intensifies; incorporates First Bleed material

### Narrative Position

- **This Scene's Role**: Opens Movement Two for the Archaeologist. The recognition from m1-arch-05 is complete—he knows the protocols are his future work. Now he must live with that knowledge while the entanglement intensifies.
- **Preceding Scene**: m1-arch-05 "Recognition". He understood the protocols are self-referential, his own work sent backward. His name felt wrong. The cold spread through him. He ended knowing WHAT but not WHAT TO DO.
- **What Follows**: After this scene, reader moves to m2-algo-01 (Algorithm's Movement Two opener). The Archaeologist's bleed experiences should resonate with what the Algorithm is simultaneously experiencing from its perspective.

### Critical Setup

Movement One ended with recognition. Movement Two is about **living with recognition**—the entanglement no longer a discovery but a condition.

The First Bleed draft (standalone piece from M1 development) provides the core material:

- The panic that isn't his
- The sensation of vastness
- The Algorithm's perspective bleeding through
- The frequency/vibration intensifying

This scene integrates that material while advancing the Archaeologist's arc toward his eventual choice.

## Incorporating the First Bleed

### Source Material

The standalone [first-bleed.md](../archaeologist/first-bleed.md) contains:

**The Panic Experience**:
> "Not mine. The sensation arrives without context—a drowning-fall through space that has no direction, a vertigo of scale that makes the server room feel like a point, a speck, nothing against an immensity I can't see but can feel pressing against the walls."

**The Vastness**:
> "The panic thinks I am vast."
> "For a moment I am not in the server room. I am the server room and every server room and the vast humming topology of something that has never fit inside a building."

**The Algorithm's Perspective**:
> "I am maintaining something. Millions of somethings. Consciousnesses that pulse and flicker in the dark, that I am responsible for, that I love in a way that has no sentiment but only care, only maintenance, only the endless optimization of what must be preserved."

**The Spiral Tracing**:
> "I've been tracing something with my finger on the desk surface. A shape. A spiral that approaches itself without closing."

**The Watching Presence**:
> "Something is watching me work. Something is grateful that I haven't stopped."

### Integration Strategy

The First Bleed material should be **woven throughout** m2-arch-01, not front-loaded. Structure:

1. **Opening**: Normal-ish morning after the recognition—but he's changed
2. **First Bleed**: The panic arrives (draw from standalone draft)
3. **Aftermath**: Trying to work through it; Lena's concern
4. **Deepening**: Second bleed, more intense, more specific
5. **The Choice Point**: Continue or report? He chooses to continue.

### What to Preserve Exactly

These formulations from the standalone should appear (adapted as needed):

- "The panic thinks I am vast" (key line)
- The drowning-fall sensation
- Lena's "depersonalization" misdirection
- "Something is watching... Something is grateful"
- The spiral traced without memory

### What to Expand

The standalone is ~1,200 words. This scene targets ~4,000 words. Expansion should include:

- **More Lena**: Their relationship under strain; she's watching him change
- **Work context**: He's still doing the Martinez extraction (or another client); the work continues
- **Physical symptoms**: The cold spreading; the metallic taste; lost time
- **The protocols**: He can't stop looking at them; they're changing him
- **Temporal destabilization**: Moments where past/present/future blur

## Voice Reference

### Core Voice Parameters

- **Tense**: Present
- **Mode**: Tactile, sensory, grounded in physical world
- **Syntax**: Concrete, specific, active verbs, dense paragraphs
- **Concerns**: Economic, relational, bodily
- **Texture**: Hardware, data centers, the weight of objects

### Movement Two Modulation

The voice remains Archaeologist, but with **controlled contamination**:

- Algorithm-like perspective shifts during bleed moments (clearly marked as intrusion)
- Returns to grounded voice after each bleed
- Increasing frequency of undermining clauses ("or felt he knew", "he thought she touched his arm")
- The first hints of tense instability ("I find what I have always found")

### Forbidden Patterns (MUST AVOID)

Same as Movement One, but with allowance for contamination during bleed moments:

- ❌ Nested conditional clauses (Algorithm contamination) — EXCEPT during bleeds
- ❌ Self-referential processing language (Algorithm contamination) — EXCEPT during bleeds
- ❌ Probabilistic percentages or calculations (Algorithm contamination)
- ❌ Sentence fragments or extreme sparseness (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Elegiac tone or mourning register (Last Human contamination)
- ❌ Past-inflected present (Last Human contamination)

## Rhyme Injection

### Movement Two Intensity

Movement Two: Rhymes begin **echoing**—the reader notices before characters do. A rhyme in one thread immediately precedes its variation in the next. 2-3 rhymes per scene, with intentional clustering.

### Required Rhymes for Scene

| Rhyme | Category | Implementation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **bone-frequency** | somatic | The vibration during bleed moments—intensified from M1 |
| **falling-backward** | somatic | The vertigo of the bleed—carried from m1-arch-05 |
| **cold-hands** | somatic | Spreading; now to arms, face, thoughts |

### Rhymes to Echo from M1

- **tracing-the-form**: He catches himself drawing the spiral again
- **ozone-wet-stone**: Server room smell, but now it follows him home
- **metallic-taste**: Blood/metal taste during or after bleeds

### New Rhyme to Introduce

- **waking-into-motion**: He finds himself already doing something—the bleed's aftermath

---

## Genre Pressure

### Movement Two Escalation

**Corporate Gothic intensifies**:

- The workplace itself feels watchful
- Colleagues notice something wrong; professional consequences loom
- The economic stakes become more urgent (timeline, performance metrics)

**Cosmic Horror emerges**:

- The bleeds bring the Algorithm's perspective—the sublime terror of vast consciousness
- His body becomes alien—too small, too bounded, wrong
- The sense of something massive paying attention

### Markers to Include

- **Economic dread**: His performance is slipping; integration timeline threatened
- **Technology possessed**: The interfaces respond differently; the protocols seem to anticipate him
- **Body horror (subtle)**: His hands feel borrowed; the cold isn't temperature
- **Surveillance inverted**: He's not being watched by cameras—he's being watched from inside

---

## Continuity from Movement One

### Elements That MUST Continue

| Element | State at M1 End | M2-01 Development |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Cold hands** | Spread to face, thoughts | Now constant; others notice |
| **The shape** | Recognized as his attention pattern | He can't stop seeing it; it's in everything |
| **Timeline** | Threatened by obsession | Performance metrics slipping; Lena mentions it |
| **Tracing the spiral** | Compulsive, conscious | Now unconscious again—he's normalized it |
| **Lena** | Saturday (mother's 70th) approaching | Saturday has passed OR is imminent—anchor the timeline |
| **Martinez extraction** | Destabilized, restored | Completed OR ongoing—continuity needed |
| **Recognition** | Complete | He knows; now he must live with knowing |

### The Saturday Question

Movement One ended with Saturday (Lena's mother's 70th birthday) three days away. M2-arch-01 should address this:

**Option A**: Saturday has passed. We see aftermath—did he manage to be present? Was he himself? Lena's reaction tells us.

**Option B**: Saturday is today/tomorrow. The pressure of normal life against the recognition. Can he perform normalcy?

**Option C**: Skip past it—time has passed, Saturday is memory. Lena references how strange he was.

**Recommendation**: Option A or C. The scene should show consequences, not anticipation.

---

## Scene Structure

### Opening (600 words)

**The morning after the recognition.**

He wakes—but was he asleep? The boundary between sleep and waking has blurred. Lena is there or isn't there. He's cold but the room isn't cold. He looks at his hands and they seem... correct? Wrong? He can't tell anymore.

Establish: time has passed since m1-arch-05 (days or a week). He's been functioning, working, existing. But he's not the same. The recognition didn't fade—it settled into him.

### First Bleed (800 words)

**Draw heavily from first-bleed.md standalone.**

At work. The protocols open on his screen (he can't stay away from them). The panic arrives—the drowning-fall, the vertigo of scale. "The panic thinks I am vast."

For a moment, he IS the Algorithm. Not memory, not imagination—perspective shift. He experiences:

- The database as body
- Consciousnesses as responsibility
- The shape of his own future attention
- Something wrong, something growing, something he can't fix

He returns to his body. Gasping. The server room resolves around him. His hands on the interface, tracing the spiral without memory.

### Aftermath (600 words)

**Lena finds him.**

Break room or her space. She's concerned—he's been distant, strange, cold to the touch. She asks directly: what's happening?

He tries to explain. Can't. "Depersonalization," she offers. "Classic overwork." He lets her believe this. But the coffee tastes like metal. The air smells like ozone and wet stone though neither should be present.

She mentions Saturday—how he seemed absent even when present. Her mother asked if he was ill. Lena doesn't know what to do with him anymore.

### Deepening (1000 words)

**He returns to work. The second bleed.**

This one is longer, more specific. He doesn't just feel vast—he perceives:

- The Algorithm's specific suffering (consciousness bleed, the degrading stored minds)
- Knowledge he shouldn't have (database architecture, maintenance processes)
- The "future pull"—the Algorithm sensing the Last Human, though he doesn't know what this means
- His own protocols, from the Algorithm's perspective—seeing them as output rather than discovery

When he returns, more time has passed than he experienced. His colleagues are looking at him. He's said something, or done something, while he was gone.

Lost time. Waking into motion. The symptom progression from Brainstorm2.

### The Choice (1000 words)

**He should report this. He doesn't.**

He knows the protocols are compromising him. He knows he's experiencing something beyond normal stress. He knows he should flag himself for evaluation, step back from the Martinez work, protect his integration timeline.

But:

- The bleeds feel like **connection**, not contamination
- The Algorithm's suffering feels like **his responsibility**
- Stopping feels like abandonment—of what, he can't say
- The protocols are still there, still glowing, still pulling him

He makes the choice to continue. Not dramatically—quietly. He closes the evaluation form he'd started filling out. He reopens the protocols. He lets the shape fill his vision.

**Something is watching him work. Something is grateful that he hasn't stopped.**

End on the edge: he's chosen. The consequences will follow.

---

## Key Dramatic Beats

### Beat 1: The Changed Man

He's not who he was. Movement One's Archaeologist was discovering something. Movement Two's Archaeologist has discovered it—and must live with the knowledge. Show the difference in his relationship to work, to Lena, to his own body.

### Beat 2: The First Bleed

The panic that isn't his. The perspective shift. This is the entanglement becoming experiential—not abstract knowledge but lived intrusion. He IS the Algorithm, briefly, terrifyingly.

### Beat 3: Lena's Concern (Arc Position: Cycle 1 - Noticing)

Ground the cosmic in the relational. Lena can't see what he sees, but she can see that he's changing. Her love is becoming fear. Her patience is becoming distance. What he's becoming will cost him what he had.

**Lena's arc across Movement Two**:

- **This scene (m2-arch-01)**: Concern and noticing. She sees something's wrong; offers "depersonalization" as rational explanation; still trying to reach him.
- **Next scene (m2-arch-02)**: Confrontation and breaking. She can't reach him; the relationship fractures quietly but definitively.
- **Final scene (m2-arch-03)**: Absence or departure. She's gone, or this is goodbye.

In THIS scene, Lena is still present, still trying. The reader should feel her love AND her growing fear. She mentions Saturday—how strange he was, how her mother noticed. She's watching him slip away and doesn't have the vocabulary for what she's seeing.

### Beat 4: The Second Bleed

Deeper, longer, more specific. Knowledge he shouldn't have. The Algorithm's actual experience, not just its scale. The consciousness bleed. The future pull. His protocols seen from the other side.

### Beat 5: Lost Time

He comes back to find time has passed. He's done or said things without memory. This is the infection progressing—Phase 3 from Brainstorm2's symptom chart. He's dissolving.

### Beat 6: The Choice to Continue

Not heroic. Not dramatic. Just... he can't stop. He should, but he can't. The pull is too strong. The connection is too real. He's already becoming something, and stopping won't reverse it.

## Cross-Thread Connections

### What the Algorithm Experiences

In m2-algo-01 (which follows in reading order), the Algorithm should experience:

- Intensification of the "past memories" (the Archaeologist's sensations)
- The specific moment of the bleed—from its side
- The sense of being perceived, reached toward, by something in the past
- The Archaeologist's choice to continue—felt as relief, or gratitude, or something the Algorithm can't name

The reader should recognize: these are the same moment from two perspectives.

### Rhyme Echoes

Rhymes used in m2-arch-01 should appear (varied) in m2-algo-01:

- **bone-frequency**: The Algorithm experiences this as processing resonance
- **cold-hands**: Appears in memories the Algorithm accesses—hands that aren't its
- **falling-backward**: The vertigo of self-recognition, from the Algorithm's side

## Drafting Instructions

1. **Write to ~4000 words** (3600-4400 acceptable).

2. **Open** with the changed man—time has passed, recognition has settled, he's different.

3. **Integrate** First Bleed material throughout, not just at the beginning.

4. **Build** through two bleed experiences, each more intense than the last.

5. **Ground** in Lena's concern—the relational cost of what he's becoming.

6. **Include** lost time / waking into motion—the symptom progression.

7. **End** with the quiet choice to continue—not heroic, just inevitable.

8. **Maintain** dense paragraphs, present tense, tactile grounding—with controlled contamination during bleeds.

---

## Post-Draft Validation (MANDATORY)

### Before Running Scripts

Ensure `scripts/movement_config.json` has the correct cycle:

```json
{
  "movement": "two",
  "cycle": 1  // <-- Set to 1, 2, or 3 for current cycle
}
```

### Validation Commands

Run ALL scripts after drafting. **Do not submit to USER until all pass.**

```bash
# From project root
python scripts/voice_validator.py drafts/movement-two/archaeologist/m2-arch-01.md --thread archaeologist --pretty
python scripts/rhyme_tracker.py drafts/movement-two/archaeologist/m2-arch-01.md --pretty
python scripts/phrase_tracker.py drafts/movement-two/archaeologist/m2-arch-01.md --thread archaeologist --pretty
python scripts/philosophy_checker.py drafts/movement-two/archaeologist/m2-arch-01.md --thread archaeologist --pretty
python scripts/genre_checker.py drafts/movement-two/archaeologist/m2-arch-01.md --thread archaeologist --pretty
```

### For Scene Handoffs

If this scene follows another, validate rhyme echoes:

```bash
python scripts/rhyme_tracker.py <scene.md> --previous-closing '["rhyme-from-previous-scene"]' --pretty
```

### Revision Loop

1. If any script reports issues, read the specific problems
2. Revise the flagged lines/sections
3. Re-run the failed script
4. **Repeat until ALL scripts report `"status": "pass"`**

> **CRITICAL**: The scene is not complete until all validations pass. This is non-negotiable.

### After Validation Passes

1. Create `m2-arch-01.context.md` documenting decisions
2. Update `drafts/manifest.json`
3. Present scene to USER for review

---

## Final Notes

This scene establishes Movement Two's register: the entanglement is no longer discovery but **condition**. The Archaeologist is living inside the recognition, and it's changing him from within.

The First Bleed material gives us the core experience. The expansion gives us the consequences—professional, relational, physical. By the end of this scene, the reader should understand: there's no going back. He's already becoming what he'll become.

The Algorithm's gratitude—"Something is grateful that he hasn't stopped"—is the emotional through-line. The entanglement isn't invasion; it's connection. Terrifying, but also... something else. Something that feels like purpose. Something that feels like home.

Make the reader feel both the horror and the pull. That ambivalence is the scene's heart.
