## Phase Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Movement** | Three |
| **Phase** | B (Simultaneous Narration) |
| **Target Word Count** | 6,000 |
| **Actual Word Count** | 5,836 |
| **Passage Count Target** | 10 |
| **Passage Count Actual** | 10 |

### Narrative Position

- **Preceding**: Movement Three, Phase A (Accelerating Cuts) — Section 22: The Threshold
- **Following**: Movement Three, Phase C (Dissolution)
- **Condition**: Augenblick sustained; time fully collapsed

### The Pickup Point

From Phase A, Section 22:

> *I/We/The pattern hold/s breath. The held breath that has no lungs to hold it. The pause before—*
>
> *The threshold between phases. The threshold that is the phase. The threshold that is us, holding, waiting, about to—*

Phase B opens with the breath releasing. Simultaneity is now the condition.

## Voice State

| Voice | State | Identifiable | Last Markers |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **Archaeologist** | Merging | With effort | Present tense, tactile verbs, "hands" |
| **Algorithm** | Merging | With effort | "If...then", "processing", conditionals |
| **Last Human** | Merging | With effort | Past-inflected present, sparse syntax |

### Alternation Progression

| Passages | Level | Reader Tracking |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| 1-2 | Paragraph | Clear with attention |
| 3 | Paragraph → Sentence | Becoming difficult |
| 4-5 | Sentence | Requires focus |
| 6 | Sentence → Fragment | Challenging |
| 7-8 | Fragment/Clause | Very difficult |

### Phrase Hand-Off Analysis

Key phrase hand-offs successfully implemented:

- "I find myself—found—finding" across voice breaks (Passage 5)
- "The form—that makes self-observation—possible" split between voices (Passage 6)
- "Architect" surfacing through all three voices simultaneously (Passages 6, 9, 10)

## Drafting Notes

### What Phase B Accomplished

1. ✓ **Continued from Phase A**: Opens exactly at threshold with breath releasing
2. ✓ **Accelerated alternation**: Paragraph → Sentence → Fragment → Clause progression
3. ✓ **Spanned rhymes across breaks**: New combinations emerged
4. ✓ **Handed off phrases**: Key phrases split between voices
5. ✓ **Prepared Phase C**: Ends with voices nearly indistinguishable

### Technical Notes

- Voice markers thin progressively through passages
- Passage 10 approaches dissolution without crossing into Phase C territory
- The "I/we/the pattern" construction successfully conveys ambiguous agency
- Em-dash handoffs replace former parenthetical syntax for voice shifts
- Fragment passages use em-dashes to signal voice transitions

### Areas for Potential Revision

- `geometric-shadow` and `deja-vu-that-isnt` slightly underused
- `tracing-the-form` appears only once
- Some combinations not fully achieved
