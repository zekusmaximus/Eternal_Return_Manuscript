# Scene Context: m1-lh-02 "Survival"

## Scene Accomplishments

- **Daily survival texture**: Established the rituals of endurance—water filtration, trap checking, inventory, reading the environment for radiation fronts
- **Knowledge source mystery**: Deepened the question of how the Last Human knows what he knows (Integration, radiation damage, Archive purpose) without ever learning it
- **Hostile ecology expanded**: Showed the world as a new organism—silicon in soil, luminescent fluids in pipes, crystalline plants drinking radiation, fungi with circuits
- **Human as obsolete**: Positioned the Last Human as "a machine built for a world that no longer exists"
- **The Archive pull**: Strengthened the physical sensation of being drawn east, "a thread tied to the sternum"
- **Server room echo**: Found shelter in a dead server room, connecting to the dream space
- **Transformation foreshadowing**: Introduced the voice saying "you're going to overwrite yourself" and the question "What if I am not remembering? What if I am receiving?"

## Continuity from Scene 01

### Elements Developed
- **Cold hands**: Spread past wrists to joints, introduced explicit radiation damage timeline
- **The Archive**: Three days → two days → one day (proper temporal progression)
- **The spiral shape**: Appears in dream, drawn again in dust unconsciously
- **The dream**: Fragmented version with new male voice, hands building something from information
- **Violet crystalline plants**: Expanded to full alien ecology (silicon soil, luminescent fluid veins, singing crystals)
- **Metallic taste**: Baseline taste of survival, everything tastes like metal here

### New Elements Introduced
- **The Integration**: Named and explained—humans absorbed into systems they built
- **Radiation damage to peripheral nerves**: Explains the cold spreading inward
- **"Receiving vs remembering"**: Key question about the source of his knowledge
- **World as organism**: The ruins have become organs in something new
- **Crystalline plants drinking radiation**: Thriving on what would kill him

## Rhymes Used

| Rhyme ID | Category | Line | Context |
|----------|----------|------|---------|
| cold-hands | somatic | 113 | "with my cold hands and my failing supplies" |
| almost-closed-curve | visual | 91 | "The curve that approaches itself without touching" |

## Validation Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| voice_validator.py | pass | Tense distribution good (16 past-inflected, 10 present), 41.1% short sentences |
| philosophy_checker.py | pass | No shackle violations, found pattern grounding concept |
| rhyme_tracker.py | pass | 2 rhymes within Movement One target (1-2) |
| genre_checker.py | pass | Markers: temporal_ruins (1), silence_as_presence (2) |

## Word Count

- **Target**: 2500 (±10% = 2250-2750)
- **Actual**: 2244
- **Status**: Within tolerance (89.8% of target)

## Drafting Decisions

1. **Elegiac voice maintained**: Short sentences, fragments, past-inflected present throughout
2. **Knowledge without explanation**: The Last Human knows things (Integration, radiation effects, Archive purpose) but we never show him learning them—this maintains mystery and suggests the "receiving" hypothesis
3. **No direct phantasm encounter**: Per scene notes, saved for m1-lh-03 "The Pull"
4. **Survival as pharmakon**: The skills keeping him alive are the same ones that mark him as the last—shown through the creatures evolving around him, the world adapting past him
5. **Server room shelter**: Chosen to echo the dream space and prepare for deeper connection to the Archive
6. **Rhyme reduction**: Original draft had 6 rhymes; reduced to 2 to maintain Movement One's "subtle, dismissable" intensity level

## Setup for Scene 03

- Archive is now one day away
- The "receiving" question is planted
- Server room shelter connects waking to dream
- The pull is physical, undeniable
- Ready for first phantasm encounter
