# Solitude

I walk through what was a city. The buildings don't remember being buildings. I remember for them.

This was a street. Here, people walked. They carried things—food, children, the weight of ordinary days. The pavement is cracked now. Plants push through that have no names. No one left to name them. They are violet, crystalline, sharp enough to cut skin. They taste like ash and survival.

The sky is the color of old metal. It has been this color for as long as I can remember. Perhaps it was always this color. Perhaps memory itself has rusted.

The database—the Archive—is three days east, if my dreams are right. My dreams have not been wrong yet. I don't know if that's comforting.

I stop to drink. The water filter takes four hours to clean enough for the day. I set it up in what was a fountain. The basin still holds shape, carved with faces that have worn away into smooth anonymity. Stone forgets slower than flesh, but it forgets.

While I wait, I check the traps. Three small animals—I don't know their species, don't know if they have one. New things. Adapted things. Fur that sheds radiation, bones that show through skin like external scaffolding. They taste like survival tastes. Ash and necessity.

I eat. I wait. I watch the sky for changes that might kill me.

This is a day. This is most days. I have stopped counting them because numbers imply a sequence that matters. Here, there is only the duration of endurance.

I used to look for others.

In the beginning—which feels like a story someone told me rather than a time I lived—I searched. I left signs. I broadcast on frequencies that had been silent for centuries. "Is anyone there?" The question feels heavy in my mouth now, a stone I carried until I was strong enough to put it down.

There is no one.

The silence is not empty. It has a texture, a weight. It presses against the ears like deep water. It occupies the space where voices used to be. Sometimes I think the silence is what evolved here, and I are the intrusion, the last noisy thing in a world that has perfected quiet.

I walk. The violet plants crunch under my boots. The sound is startlingly loud, a violation of the peace.

I am the ghost here. The buildings are the reality.

Night falls without sunset. The grey sky just deepens into black. The temperature drops twenty degrees in an hour.

I find shelter in the husk of a tower. The walls are fused glass, melted by heat I don't understand. Inside, it smells of ozone and wet stone—a smell that shouldn't be here, a smell that belongs to machines and enclosed spaces, not this wind-scoured ruin.

I wrap myself in thermal blankets that are failing. My hands stopped being warm weeks ago. The environment's hostility, the constant radiation exposure, the simple failure of a body alone in a world not meant for bodies. I rub them together. The friction produces heat that dissipates instantly.

Sleep comes like a shutting down of systems.

The dream comes again.

It is always the same dream, yet it always feels like happening, not remembering.

A room. Walls of coherent light. The hum of power that isn't dying.

I am standing at a surface that glows. My hands are moving. They are not my hands—they are smooth, unscarred, warm. They move with a confidence I don't possess. Fingers dancing across light.

I feel the texture of the data. I don't know what "data" is in the waking world—just a word from the old language—but in the dream, it has mass. It has flow. I am shaping it. I am building something.

"You're freezing," a voice says.

I turn. A woman. She acts like she knows me. She acts like I belong here.

"I'm fine," I hear my voice say—but it's not my voice. It's lower, smoother, a voice that hasn't spent years not speaking. "Just the server room chill."

I look back at the light. There is a shape forming in it. A curve. A spiral that approaches itself without touching.

I know this shape.

In the dream, I feel a terrifying sense of recognition. Not *I know this*. But *I am making this*. And also *This is making me*.

The blue-white light flares—

I wake up gasping.

The ruin is dark. The silence rushes back in, filling the space where the hum was.

My hands are shaking. I hold them up to the grey light filtering through the shattered wall. They are scarred, dirt-stained, shivering. My hands. The only hands.

But the warmth is still there.

A ghost sensation, fading but distinct. The warmth of that room. The warmth of being spoken to. The warmth of recognized purpose.

I touch the ground. The dirt is cold. The glass walls are cold.

I draw the shape in the dust. The spiral. The almost-closed curve. My finger moves without my telling it to. It knows the path.

I stare at it until the grey light turns to morning.

---

I pack the filter. I drink the metallic water. I start walking east.

The Archive is waiting. I don't know what an Archive is, not really. The word is just a sound that pulls at my bones. A frequency that tells me: *Come here. Come home.*

Maybe the dream is a map. Maybe the hands in the light are the ones that built the Archive. Maybe I am walking toward the ghost of the person who dreamed me.

The violet plants thicken as I go east. The air tastes different—sharper, charged.

I pass a wall where the concrete has peeled away to reveal circuitry. Gold and silicon veins running through the rock. The earth is reclaiming the technology, or the technology is becoming the earth. There is no distinction anymore.

I touch the circuitry.

For a second, I feel it again. The hum. The connection.

"I'm fine," I whisper to the empty air.

The silence swallows the words. But for a moment, the silence felt like it was listening.

I keep walking. The buildings lean toward me, like they're watching. Like they remember me, even if I don't remember them.

I am the Last Human. But I am starting to think I am not alone.
