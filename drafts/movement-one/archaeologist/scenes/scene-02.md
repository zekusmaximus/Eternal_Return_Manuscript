# The Client: Integration Prep

The Martinez contract arrives at 6:47 AM, embedded in the standard intake packet: digital signature fields, liability waivers, the dense legal architecture that lets grieving families sign away their privacy in exchange for a version of their father who can settle arguments from beyond death.

I sign without reading the fine print. I've signed a hundred of these. The language hasn't changed in years.

What's changed is the number at the bottom. Triple fee. Ninety days.

I do the math while the confirmation processes. Forty-eight thousand credits for excavation alone. The integration package on top—that's the family's expense, not mine—but my cut is enough to matter. Enough to shave eight months off my timeline. Sixty-three becomes fifty-five. Still years away. Still too far. But closer. Measurably, materially closer.

The interface chimes. Contract accepted. Martinez data begins its transfer—the Authority routing petabytes through secure channels, encryption keys flowering in my inbox like strange digital orchids.

I put my palm flat on the desk. Feel the cool polymer. Ground myself in the physical.

Eight months. That's what this dead man's secrets are worth. Eight months of my life, bought with his.

Lena finds me three hours into the preliminary sort.

She doesn't knock—we stopped knocking after the first year—but she pauses at the threshold of my workstation, coffee in hand, watching me work. I feel her presence before I see her. Something about the way the air changes when she's near.

"You took it." Not a question.

"I took it." I don't look up from the visualization. The Martinez data blooms in the projection field, a galaxy of files orbiting the central mass of his consciousness signature. High density. Emotional complexity off the charts. This man kept everything.

"I thought you said you couldn't split focus from Vasquez."

"Vasquez finished at four this morning. Final integration package is queued."

Lena sets the coffee on my desk—exactly where it won't interfere with the projection, exactly where my hand will find it without looking. Three years of calibration. Three years of her timing the brew to my patterns.

"You haven't slept."

"I'll sleep when I'm integrated."

It's a bad joke. We both know it. She doesn't laugh, but her mouth does something complicated—halfway between a smile and something sadder.

"Scoot over."

I make room at the interface. She pulls a chair close—closer than professional, not quite as close as something else. Her shoulder brushes mine as she reaches into the projection field.

"Walk me through what you're seeing."

---

The intake process has a rhythm to it. Like an autopsy, but gentler. Like a séance, but with better documentation.

First you map the surface layer—the public data, the things they let the world see. Social feeds, professional records, the carefully curated persona that most people mistake for identity. Martinez's surface layer is polished: executive headshots, keynote addresses, philanthropic donations that always seemed to coincide with tax season.

Then you go deeper. Private communications. Financial records. Medical history. The stuff people think will die with them. The stuff that makes integration work.

Roberto Martinez. Sixty-one years old. Chief Technology Officer at a company that made its fortune optimizing supply chains during the collapse years—routing food and medicine around disaster zones, keeping logistics alive while the infrastructure crumbled. His obituary called him a humanitarian. His financial records tell a different story: war profiteering with better marketing. The medical files show a man who knew he was dying for eighteen months and didn't tell his children until the last week.

None of that matters for the integration. Not really. The ethics of a life don't determine the quality of its preservation. What matters is the data—the density, the coherence, the emotional anchors that let the pattern hold together when you upload it into something that doesn't have a body anymore.

"He documented everything," I tell Lena, rotating the visualization so she can see the clusters. "Personal journals going back forty years. Video logs. Audio memos. The man talked to himself constantly—narrated his own life like he knew someone would be listening."

"Someone was. Is." Lena highlights a dense cluster near the center. "What's this?"

"Family correspondence. Three children, two ex-wives, one current. Thousands of messages. The integration algorithm is going to have a lot of relational material to work with."

"The kids are the ones fighting."

"The kids are always the ones fighting. But there's a lot of love here too." I expand one of the message threads—father to eldest daughter, spanning decades. The emotional signatures cycle through conflict and reconciliation, distance and closeness, the whole complicated choreography of parents and children trying to understand each other across the gulf of generations. "He tried. You can see him trying."

"Does that make it harder or easier?"

I don't have an answer for her. The work doesn't care about moral complexity. The work only cares about pattern integrity.

Lena's hand finds my shoulder. Her fingers are warm. Mine are cold again—the server room chill that never quite leaves my bones these days.

"You're freezing," she says.

"The climate control—"

"It's not the climate control. It's you." She doesn't move her hand. "When did you last eat?"

"I don't—" The sentence dies. I genuinely don't remember. There was coffee. There might have been food. "It doesn't matter."

"It matters." Her grip tightens briefly, then releases. "Eight months off your timeline isn't worth anything if you don't make it to the threshold intact."

She's right. She's always right about the practical things. That's what makes her good at this work, and what makes working with her feel like being seen by someone who knows exactly how broken you are.

"There's a café two levels down," I say. "Real eggs on Thursdays."

"It's Thursday."

"Is it?"

The smile reaches her eyes this time. "Come on. Martinez will still be dead when we get back."

---

The café smells like cooking oil and filtered air, the particular aromatics of food service in a building that recycles its atmosphere. Real eggs—or close enough to real, the kind that came from actual chickens before the supply chain optimizations made them rare—sit steaming on plates that have seen better decades.

Lena eats methodically. I push mine around, trying to remember hunger.

"Why do we do this?" The question comes out before I've decided to ask it.

She pauses, fork halfway to her mouth. "Eat breakfast?"

"Work together. You're forty-one months out. I'm—" The number catches in my throat. "Further. Why do you keep finding me contracts? Why do you time your coffee to my patterns? Why do you—"

"Because you're good at this." Simple. Direct. The way Lena handles everything. "Better than good. The clients I refer to you have integration success rates fifteen percent above baseline. You see things the rest of us miss. You find the emotional anchors that make the pattern hold."

"That's professional."

"It is."

"But that's not all of it."

She sets down her fork. Studies me with eyes that have seen a lot of dead people's data, a lot of families trying to hold onto something that's already gone.

"No," she says. "That's not all of it."

The silence stretches. I wait. Lena's never been good at silence—she fills it, usually, with the practical concerns that keep us both moving forward. But this time she lets it breathe.

"I lost someone," she says finally. "Before I started this work. Someone who didn't make the threshold. Someone who should have."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. It's not your grief to carry." She picks up her fork again. Takes a bite. Chews and swallows like the conversation hasn't shifted into territory we don't usually visit. "I do this work because I couldn't save him. I help you because—"

She stops. Looks at me. Really looks, the way she does when she's assessing data density, when she's calculating emotional signatures.

"Because you remind me that the work matters. That the people we prepare, the patterns we preserve—they're not just files. They're not just revenue. They're someone's attempt to keep existing. And you treat them like that. Every time."

I don't know what to say. So I eat my eggs. They taste like something I should remember.

"My brother," I say, finally. The words come out heavier than I expect. "Marcus. He'll never make the threshold. He's not even trying. Works service jobs, saves nothing, acts like mortality is a feature instead of a bug."

"Some people don't want to live forever."

"Some people don't understand what dying means."

Lena's quiet for a long moment. When she speaks, her voice is careful. "What does dying mean? To you?"

The question catches me off guard. I've spent years helping other people avoid death—or at least the permanent version of it—but I've never put my own fear into words.

"It means stopping," I say. "Not just the body stopping. The pattern stopping. Everything I've learned, everything I've felt, all the connections between thoughts that make me specifically *me*—gone. Not sleeping. Not changing. Gone. Like I never existed at all."

"And integration fixes that?"

"Integration continues it. The pattern persists. The wave keeps moving, even after the water changes."

She's watching me with something that might be pity, might be recognition. "The Authority's marketing language. Word for word."

"It's true."

"It might be true. We don't actually know what happens inside the substrate. We just know something continues. Something that carries the pattern forward." She pushes her plate aside, empty now. "But pattern and identity aren't the same thing. You know that better than most. You've seen what integration does when the anchors don't hold."

I have. Fragmented consciousnesses. Personalities that drift over time, losing coherence, becoming something that remembers being human without quite understanding what that meant. The failure states aren't death—they're something worse.

"That's why I do this work," I say. "That's why the excavation matters. Find the right anchors. Preserve the right patterns. Give them the best chance of staying themselves."

"And who does that for you? When it's your turn?"

The question hangs between us. I don't have an answer.

"Come on," Lena says, standing. "Your dead man is waiting."

---

Martinez's data takes a different shape when we return.

I notice it immediately—a distortion in the visualization that wasn't there before. The galaxy of files has shifted, clusters reorganizing around a new gravitational center. Something dense. Something the sorting algorithm has pulled to prominence.

"That's strange," Lena says. She's at her own station now, running parallel analysis, but I see her attention snap to my display.

"It's probably a large media file. Video compression throws off the initial mapping." I expand the cluster, expecting to find archived footage—Martinez documenting his life, narrating his own importance.

What I find instead is code.

Not the integration protocols. Not the standard optimization packages. Something else. Something that looks like my own work, but older. Impossibly older.

"Lena."

She's beside me in seconds. Professional instinct. When another excavator says your name in that tone, you move.

"What am I looking at?"

"I don't know." The code fills the projection field now, lines of syntax that follow conventions I recognize—follow conventions I invented. My KL-7 signature. My compression heuristics. My particular habit of leaving notes to myself in second person.

*// the folder will know which axis*
*// trust the pattern*
*// this is how it works*

"That's your code," Lena says. Her voice has gone flat. The voice she uses when something doesn't make sense and she needs it to make sense.

"It looks like my code."

"It IS your code. I've reviewed enough of your integration packages to recognize your style. That second-person commenting—nobody else does that."

I pull the metadata. Origin timestamp. File creation date. Modification history.

The numbers don't parse. They can't parse. The file predates my career by twenty years. The file predates my *birth* by five.

"There's been a corruption." Even as I say it, I know it's wrong. The metadata is clean. The checksums validate. The file sits in the Martinez archive like it's always been there, like it was waiting.

"Run the verification again."

I do. Same result.

"Again."

Same result.

Lena's hand finds my shoulder. Her fingers are still warm. Mine have gone colder than the server room can explain.

"This is what you found in Vasquez," she says. Not a question. "The shape you wouldn't talk about."

I hadn't told her. I'd shown her the photograph, the geometry that shouldn't exist, but I'd framed it as a glitch. A curiosity. Not something that was following me across clients, across archives, across the boundaries of what should be possible.

"It's not the same."

"Isn't it?"

The code pulses in the projection field. I'm reading it without deciding to read it—my eyes tracking the logic, my mind parsing the structure.

COMPRESSION_HEURISTIC.
Emotional-memory-folding.
Signature: KL-7.recursive.

A methodology I haven't invented yet. A shortcut I discovered three months ago and haven't published.

*// NOTE: shortcut discovered 2047.03.14
// (excavator will recognize this date)*

March 14th, 2047. Four months from now. A date I would have no reason to remember—except that now I will. Now I can't forget it.

"The file knows when I'll discover the method it uses." The words come out wrong, too quiet, too certain. "The file predicted its own obsolescence."

"That's not possible."

"No." I close the visualization. My hands are shaking. I put them flat on the desk and feel the polymer's cool indifference. "It's not."

But the code is still there, buried in a dead man's archive, waiting for me to find it.

Waiting for me to become whoever wrote it.

---

I send Lena home at midnight.

She doesn't want to go—I see it in the set of her shoulders, the way her hand lingers on the doorframe. Her fingers brush the frame like she's deciding whether to turn back.

"You could leave it," she says. "Flag it for the Authority. Let their technical teams handle whatever this is."

"I could."

"But you won't."

It's not a question. She knows me too well—knows the way I can't let go of a problem, the way my mind loops on inconsistencies until they resolve or break me.

"Sleep eventually," she says. "Your body doesn't care about your timeline."

"Noted."

She almost turns. Stops. Looks at me with eyes that have spent three years calibrating to my patterns.

"Whatever this is," she says, "whatever you find in that code—it doesn't change the work. The work still matters. Martinez still needs excavation. His kids still need a version of their father they can argue with. That's real. That's what we do."

"I know."

"Good." Now she turns. "I'll bring coffee in the morning. The expensive kind."

"It's always the expensive kind."

"You're worth it."

The door closes. The server room settles back into its hum.

She understands why I need to be alone with this. Some discoveries you have to make in private, before you can decide what they mean.

The Martinez data surrounds me. Terabytes of a man's existence, organized into clusters and subclusters, emotional signatures mapped and weighted. Somewhere in there, his children are waiting for a version of their father who can tell them what to do. Somewhere in there, his whole life is becoming the scaffold for something that will think it remembers being him.

The anomalous code sits in quarantine. I've isolated it from the main excavation—standard protocol for corrupted files—but I keep finding excuses to check on it. To open the container. To read the lines that shouldn't exist.

*when encoding GRIEF {*
*    do not flatten to single valence*
*    preserve the oscillation between*
*        - presence-felt*
*        - presence-absent*
*        - presence-remembered-as-absent*
*        - absence-felt-as-presence*

This is my code. My philosophy. My understanding of how grief actually works—not as a single emotion but as an oscillation, a standing wave between states that never fully resolves. I've used this principle in dozens of integrations. It's why my success rates run high.

But I've never written it down. I've never formalized it. It exists only in my intuitive approach to the work, in the way my hands move through the data without my mind deciding.

The code formalized it before I knew there was something to formalize.

The scroll continues. More of my methods, laid out in syntax that predates their invention.

*fold along axis of FIRST_LOSS*
*(the one they don't talk about)*
*(the folder will know which)*

The one they don't talk about. For Martinez, that would be—I check the timeline, cross-reference the emotional signatures—his younger brother. Dead at nineteen. Car accident. The whole family stopped mentioning him after the funeral; his name appears in early records and then vanishes, a hole in the data that speaks louder than any documented grief.

The code knew to look for that hole. The code knew it would be there.

I hold my breath. Old habit. Waiting for data to move.

The server room hums around me. The air smells of ozone and dust and the faint metallic tang of hardware working too hard. The climate control reads seventeen degrees, but I'm shivering.

My finger traces something on the desk. A spiral that refuses to close.

---

The Martinez integration will take ninety days. That's what the contract specifies. That's what the family is paying for.

Ninety days to excavate a man's existence. To map the emotional topology of sixty-one years. To prepare a consciousness scaffold that will let something wake up in Finland believing it used to be Roberto Martinez, humanitarian profiteer, father of three, keeper of too many secrets.

Ninety days to shave eight months off my timeline. Fifty-five months becomes the number in my head—closer than sixty-three, close enough to feel like progress.

But the code changes the calculation.

Because if the code is real—if it predicted its own discovery, if it uses methods I haven't invented yet—then the timeline isn't what I thought. The substrate isn't what I thought. The work I do every day, preparing the dead for digital existence, might be preparing something else entirely.

I open the quarantine container one more time. Let the code fill my vision.

*// the reader is the writer*
*// the writer is the reader*
*// continue: next_layer*

There are seven excavation sites mentioned in the fragment. Seven locations where more of this code waits to be discovered. The file estimates 847 hours of reconstruction work.

I check my timeline. Factor in the Martinez contract, the pending jobs, the hours I already spend on routine excavation.

847 hours. Almost exactly what I have before my next major deadline.

The code knew that too.

The server room hums. My hands are cold, and somewhere in the distance—in the space between the servers, in the frequency beneath the fan noise—something is waiting.

Something that has always been waiting.

I close my eyes. Feel the spiral I keep drawing without deciding to. The shape I saw in Eleanor's photograph. The shape I'll find again in Martinez's code.

The shape that knows who I am before I know it myself.

I open my eyes. Get to work.

The data is moving. It's always been moving.

And now I can see where it's going.
