# Opening: Daily Excavation

The drive clicks twice before spinning up.

Old habit—I hold my breath until I hear data moving. The sound has a texture to it: the initial mechanical protest, then the settling hum, then the whisper of read-heads tracking across magnetic surfaces that hold someone's entire existence. Three terabytes. Forty-seven years of photographs, messages, financial records, medical files, the digital residue of a life that ended six weeks ago. Her children are paying me to make her immortal.

The server room is cold tonight. Colder than usual. The climate control protests when I check the readout—seventeen degrees Celsius, within spec—but my hands feel like I've been holding ice. I flex my fingers and get to work.

Her name was Eleanor Vasquez. Seventy-three years old. Retired structural engineer, widowed twice, three children who pooled their inheritance to afford the integration fee. The intake form lists her as "medium complexity, high emotional density"—marketing language for someone who lived fully and left a lot of data behind. I've been excavating her files for two weeks now. I know her better than her children do. I know which photographs she looked at most often. I know which messages she never deleted. I know the search history she thought was private, the late-night queries about pain management and dignity and whether consciousness persists after upload.

I know she was afraid. And I know she did it anyway.

The interface glows blue-white in the dim room. I settle into the chair—good ergonomics, bad for my back anyway—and begin tonight's extraction.

Integration archaeology is exactly what it sounds like: digging through the layers of someone's digital life, cataloging the artifacts, mapping the stratigraphy of their personality. The Integration Authority calls us "consciousness preparation specialists." The industry calls us excavators. My tax forms say "freelance data archaeologist." What I actually do is read dead people's emails until I understand them well enough to help a computer become them.

It's not resurrection. The Authority is very clear about that. The integrated consciousness is a continuation, not a copy. The pattern persists even as the substrate changes. Like a wave moving through water—same wave, different molecules. The philosophy papers go on for thousands of pages, dense with terminology I've never fully grasped. What I understand is simpler: Eleanor Vasquez is dead. In eighteen months, something that thinks it's Eleanor Vasquez will wake up in a server farm in Finland, and it will remember being afraid, and it will remember deciding to do it anyway, and it will believe those memories are its own.

Whether that constitutes survival is above my pay grade. What I know is that the Vasquez children are paying forty thousand credits for the basic integration package, plus another twelve thousand for my excavation work, plus whatever the Authority charges for ongoing maintenance. The wealthy live forever. The rest of us save up.

I've been saving for eleven years. At current rates, I'm sixty-three months from threshold. Assuming no price increases. Assuming no major life disruptions. Assuming the industry doesn't collapse under the weight of its own contradictions.

Assumptions are dangerous in this business. So I work. I excavate. I learn dead people's secrets and prepare them for a future they'll never consciously experience.

The drive hums. Eleanor's photographs load in chronological order. I start with the oldest—image quality degraded, color values shifted, the aesthetic of an era I've only seen in archives. She's young here. Twenty, maybe. Standing in front of a building I don't recognize, squinting into sunlight, wearing clothes that look historical and probably weren't. Her smile is unguarded in a way that later photographs won't show.

I tag the emotional signature: *joy, confidence, anticipation*. The integration algorithm will use this as an anchor point. A baseline for who she was before life started layering complications on top.

This is the work. Hours of it. Cataloging the moments that made someone who they were, feeding them into systems that promise to reconstruct the pattern. I don't know if it works—really works, in the way the marketing suggests. I just know it's the only option.

I scroll forward. The photographs age. Eleanor ages with them.

Lena arrives at midnight with coffee and a question.

The coffee is good—she sources it from somewhere I've never asked about, real beans, not the synthesized stuff that tastes like someone described coffee to a machine. The question is harder.

"Did you look at the Martinez intake?" She sets the cup on my desk, far enough from the interface to avoid accidents. We've been working adjacent for three years now; she knows my habits. Knows I'll forget to drink it. Knows I need the ritual anyway.

"Not yet." I pause the excavation, Eleanor's face frozen on screen at age forty-something, still smiling but with different eyes. "High priority?"

"High payment." Lena pulls a chair over, straddles it backward, rests her chin on her folded arms. She looks tired. We all look tired. "Family is offering accelerated rates. Estate of some tech executive, died unexpectedly, kids want the integration done in ninety days."

"Ninety days isn't enough for proper excavation."

"They're offering triple the standard fee."

I take a sip of coffee. It's exactly the right temperature, which means she timed the brewing to my work patterns. A small kindness. The kind of thing you notice after three years. "Why the rush?"

"The kids are fighting over the will. They think if Dad's integrated, he can settle the dispute himself." Lena's laugh is short, humorless. "Won't work, of course. Integrated consciousness doesn't have legal standing for inheritance decisions. But by the time the courts work that out, they'll have a version of their father to argue with. That's what they're paying for."

"Family therapy by excavation."

"Something like that."

I turn back to Eleanor's face on the screen. She's at someone's graduation in this series—one of her kids, probably. Proud but tired. The exhaustion of decades visible in how she holds her shoulders.

"I can't take Martinez yet," I say. "Vasquez has two weeks left on timeline. If I split focus now, the integration quality drops."

Lena nods. She expected this answer. "I'll take it. Just wanted to offer you first refusal." She stands, and her hand brushes my shoulder as she goes. Not quite accidental. Not quite intentional. Three years of not-quite, stretched across late nights and shared coffee and the strange intimacy of working with the dead.

"Lena."

She stops at the door.

"How close are you?"

The pause lasts long enough to become its own answer. "Forty-one months," she says. "Maybe forty, if the Martinez job goes well." She doesn't turn around. "You?"

"Sixty-three."

Another pause. "You should take the high-value jobs when they come. You're better at this than I am." Now she does turn, and her smile is complicated. "Faster. More thorough. The clients notice."

"Speed isn't everything."

"No," she agrees. "But time is." And she's gone, back to her own station, her own dead client, her own race against a threshold that keeps moving farther away.

I drink the coffee. It's still exactly the right temperature.

The photograph that changes everything appears at 3:17 AM.

I'm deep in Eleanor's forties now—career at peak, children grown, second husband still alive. The images have taken on the glossy professionalism of that era's capture technology. Perfect color. Perfect resolution. No visible decay.

There's a conference photograph. Some engineering summit, judging by the logos on the banners. Eleanor stands in the second row, wearing a professional smile that doesn't reach her eyes. She's tired here. You can see it in the set of her jaw, the slight tension in her shoulders. Working too hard. Caring too much. The same exhaustion I see in my own reflection after late nights like this one.

My eyes start to drift closed. I should take a break. I should—

I snap awake. Not from falling asleep—from something else. A wrongness in the image I didn't consciously register.

I scroll back. Find the photograph. Zoom.

Eleanor's face fills my screen—normal, tired, professional. But behind her, in the crowd—

The shape doesn't belong. It's not a person. It's not a glitch. It's a geometry that my brain keeps sliding off, curves that approach without meeting, a structure that suggests dimensions the image shouldn't contain. My eyes water trying to focus. The shape is small—thumb-sized in the original resolution, barely visible at standard zoom. But once I see it, I can't unsee it.

I zoom farther. The shape grows. It doesn't pixelate the way it should. It maintains its impossible geometry even as the surrounding image degrades into blocky artifacts.

Something hums in the server room. Not the drives—those have a different pitch. Not the climate control. Something deeper. Something that seems to resonate with the shape on my screen.

I put my hands flat on the desk. The polymer is cool. Real. I ground myself in the tactile: the chair's pressure against my lower back, the coffee cup's residual warmth, the slight vibration of the hardware around me. The server room is familiar. I've worked here for years. Nothing has changed.

But I can't look away from the shape. And the hum keeps building.

My fingers itch. Without thinking, I've started tracing something on the desk surface—a spiral that approaches itself without closing. I don't remember starting. I don't know how to stop.

The photograph stares back at me. Eleanor's tired smile. The impossible geometry behind her. The hum that feels like it's coming from inside my chest now.

I should log this. Report the anomaly. Let the technical team handle whatever corruption has crept into the Vasquez files.

Instead I save the image coordinates and keep excavating.

Dawn comes gray through the server room's narrow windows. I've been working for nine hours. My back aches. My eyes are dry. The coffee is long gone, and my hands have finally warmed up enough to stop shaking.

Eleanor Vasquez at seventy. Retirement party. She's letting someone else hold the camera, for once—you can see her in the center of the frame, surrounded by colleagues who probably don't remember her anymore. Her smile is genuine now. Tired, always tired, but happy. She made it. She built a life worth preserving.

I tag the emotional signature: *contentment, completion, measured hope*. The integration algorithm will use this as an endpoint anchor. This is who she became. This is the pattern that will persist when she wakes up in Finland, in a substrate that doesn't know cold or exhaustion, in a consciousness that will have her memories without her body's accumulated complaints.

The rich live forever. The rest of us save up.

My fingers find the desk surface again. The spiral pattern is still there, worn into the polymer by hours of unconscious tracing. It matches nothing in my training. It matches nothing in the standard visual corruption libraries. It matches only the shape I saw behind Eleanor's tired smile—the geometry that shouldn't exist, that my brain keeps sliding off, that hums in frequencies I shouldn't be able to feel.

I close the excavation interface. Log my hours. Update the Vasquez file with tonight's progress: 847 photographs cataloged, 12,000 words of correspondence tagged, emotional density mapping at 73% complete. Standard progress. Standard work. Nothing unusual to report.

The shape stays with me as I leave the server room. It stays with me in the elevator, in the empty lobby, in the gray morning that smells of rain and exhaust and the recycled air of a city that never quite wakes up. It stays with me on the transit platform, in the faces of commuters who don't know they're already data, already cataloged, already waiting for someone like me to excavate their lives after they're gone.

Forty-seven years of photographs. Three terabytes of existence. One impossible geometry that nobody should have captured.

I get on the train. Close my eyes. Feel the hum building again in my chest, in the space between my heartbeats, in the place where I used to believe I was only myself.

The drive clicks twice before spinning up. Old habit. I hold my breath until I hear data moving.

The data is moving.

The data has always been moving.

I just couldn't see it until now.
