## Scene Accomplishments

### Worldbuilding Established

- Integration industry: consciousness "continuation" not resurrection
- Excavators: prepare data for integration
- Economic stakes: ~5 years of saving to reach threshold
- Integration Authority: regulatory body, Finland server farms
- Class dimension: "The wealthy live forever. The rest of us save up."

### Character Established

- Archaeologist: 63 months from threshold (11 years saving)
- Lena: 41 months from threshold, colleague/partner, complicated relationship
- Eleanor Vasquez: current client, 73, retired engineer, three children

### Voice Confirmed

- Present tense throughout (past tense only for describing Eleanor's photographs)
- Tactile grounding: cold hands, server hum, desk polymer, coffee temperature
- Economic concerns: fees, timeline, threshold, payment
- Direct sentences, concrete details

### First Anomaly Planted

- Geometric shape appears in Eleanor's conference photograph
- Hum begins in server room
- Unconscious tracing of spiral begins
- Shape "doesn't pixelate the way it should"

## Drafting Notes

- Opening line mirrors registry sample ("The drive clicks twice before spinning up")
- Lena relationship established through small kindnesses (coffee temperature) rather than exposition
- Economic stakes concrete: 40,000 credits basic, 12,000 excavation, 63 months from threshold
- First anomaly seeded subtly—shape appears in client's old photograph, easy to dismiss
- Ending echoes opening ("The drive clicks twice...") but transformed—now awareness that something is watching
