# The Anomaly

The Martinez extraction hits 89% at 2:47 AM.

I've been working for eleven hours straight, hands moving through emotional topographies I know better than my own, tagging correspondence and mapping relationships and building the scaffold that will hold a dead man's consciousness together when they try to resurrect him. Standard work. Excellent progress. The interface glows blue-white in the dim server room, casting my hands in the color of data, the color of the work that keeps me fifty-five months from threshold instead of fifty-seven.

The timeline number sits in the corner of my awareness like a splinter. Fifty-five months. Four years and seven months until I can afford to stop dying. The Martinez fee bought me eight months of that margin, and the next contract will buy more, and someday—if the prices hold, if the Authority doesn't adjust, if nothing goes wrong—someday the countdown will reach zero and I'll have enough to join the dead I've spent my life preparing.

My hands are cold. Colder than the server room's ambient seventeen degrees can explain. I flex my fingers and they respond slowly, stiffly, like the signals are traveling through too much distance. I've been noticing this more often lately—the cold that settles into my joints after long sessions, that doesn't leave when I step outside, that seems to come from the work itself rather than any environmental cause.

Professional hazard. That's what I tell myself. That's what I told Lena when she noticed, when she put her warm hand on my shoulder and said I was freezing. The work requires proximity to the dead. Maybe the dead take something in return.

I shake my hands, force circulation, turn back to the Martinez data.

The anomaly appears in the correspondence cluster.

I almost miss it. The visualization is dense here—thousands of messages spanning decades, emotional signatures overlapping and interweaving in patterns that the algorithm struggles to resolve. Martinez talked to everyone. Documented everything. Left a trail of communication so thick that excavating it feels less like archaeology and more like swimming through someone else's thoughts.

But there's a distortion in the cluster. A place where the data doesn't quite align.

I zoom in. The interface responds sluggishly—processing load, probably, the system straining under the weight of Martinez's obsessive self-documentation. The distortion resolves into a folder I've seen before. The same folder I quarantined three days ago. The folder containing the code that uses my methods before I invented them.

The folder is not in quarantine anymore.

I check the logs. The quarantine protocol executed correctly. The folder was isolated, flagged, moved to secure storage pending technical review. But it's here now, embedded in the correspondence cluster like it was never moved, like it's always been part of this data structure.

My finger traces a spiral on the desk. I don't decide to trace it. The motion happens while I'm reading logs, while I'm trying to understand how a quarantined file migrated back into active storage without triggering any of the security protocols designed to prevent exactly this.

I stop the tracing when I notice it. My fingertip is cold where it touched the polymer surface. The spiral I've been drawing—I've been drawing it for months, on desks, on my thigh, on the arm of the chair in my apartment—the spiral is the same shape as the thing I saw in the Martinez visualization three days ago. The topology that defies mapping. The almost-closed curve.

---

I open the folder.

I tell myself this is professional necessity. The extraction is at 89%. Whatever contamination exists in this data, I need to understand it before I deliver the integration package. The Martinez children are paying for their father's consciousness, not for whatever ghost is hiding in his files.

The visualization shifts.

The shape blooms in the projection field—the same geometry I saw before, but larger now, more present. Lines winding toward each other without touching. A structure that suggests dimensions the rendering software shouldn't be able to display. The curves approach and approach and never meet, held in an infinite asymptote that my eyes keep trying to resolve into closure.

I try to look away. I cannot look away.

The shape holds my attention the way gravity holds mass. Not through force. Through the simple consequence of presence. It's here. It's been here. It's been waiting in the Martinez data since before Martinez died, maybe since before Martinez was born, nested in the files like a splinter that the body cannot expel.

I trigger the shutdown protocol. The visualization persists.

I trigger it again. The shape doesn't flicker, doesn't fade, doesn't respond to my inputs at all. It hangs in the projection field like it's being rendered by something other than my interface, like it's drawing itself into visibility through means the software doesn't control.

The cold in my hands spreads upward. Past my wrists. Into my forearms. I feel it like a tide coming in, numbing the muscles, slowing the nerves. My fingers move through the interface commands and the commands do nothing and my fingers keep moving anyway, tracing the shape in the air now, matching the geometry of the almost-closed curve.

I don't decide to trace it. My hands know the shape before I do.

---

The code appears in the projection alongside the geometry.

Not the code from the quarantined folder—new code, or the same code in a new configuration, spreading through the Martinez data like ink through water. I watch it propagate. File by file. Cluster by cluster. The correspondence archive, the financial records, the medical history, the emotional anchor points I've spent weeks cataloging—the code touches everything.

The code is written in my methods.

I recognize the syntax. The commenting style—second person, notes to myself that I leave during long excavation sessions. The compression heuristics. The particular way I handle emotional signature mapping, folding grief along axes that preserve oscillation rather than flattening to single valence.

This is my work. This is technique I developed over years, refined through hundreds of extractions, never published, never formalized in any document the Authority would have access to. This is how I think translated into protocol.

But the timestamp is wrong.

The timestamp predates my career by twenty years. The timestamp predates my birth by five.

The déjà vu arrives like a wave cresting. Not the faint recognition I felt three days ago, the sense of having seen something before. This is overwhelming. Total. I am sitting at this workstation and I am remembering sitting at this workstation and both experiences are happening simultaneously, overlapping like transparencies layered on a light table.

I have done this before. I am doing this now. Both statements are true. The temporal separation between them is collapsing, the before and the now folding into a single moment that my mind cannot hold.

---

The code knows things I haven't learned yet.

I read it compulsively, unable to stop, unable to close the visualization even though my professional instincts are screaming that this is contamination, that this is corruption, that whatever this is cannot be part of a deliverable integration package. The code describes techniques I'm developing. Methods I've intuited but haven't formalized. Shortcuts I discovered three months ago and improvements I won't conceive for another year, laid out in syntax that predates my existence.

*// NOTE: emotional-memory-folding v2.3*
*// discovered during Martinez extraction*
*// (the excavator will recognize this moment)*

The comment references this extraction. The extraction I'm doing now. The code anticipated being found in exactly this context, by exactly this person, at exactly this point in the process.

I look at my hands. They're still tracing the shape, moving through air in patterns that match the visualization, that match the almost-closed curve, that match the geometry I've been drawing unconsciously for months. The cold has spread to my shoulders. I feel it settling into my chest, into the space behind my sternum where something has started to hum.

The humming intensifies beyond what I can contain. It presses against my sternum from inside, the same pressure I felt three days ago when I first saw the shape, before I quarantined it, before I told myself it was just a glitch. The humming is the frequency of the shape itself, translated into sensation, into a vibration that disrupts my body's rhythms even as my mind fails to parse what is happening.

The shape is not in the data.

The shape is in me. Has been in me. Is making itself visible through the data because the data is what I work with, because the shape appears in whatever medium the observer uses to observe.

---

The extraction fails.

Not crashes—fails. The 89% complete status drops to 73%, then to 61%, then to numbers that don't correspond to any metric I understand. The Martinez data is reorganizing itself around the shape, the emotional anchors I spent weeks mapping now pointing toward a new center of gravity, a new attractor that wasn't there before I opened the folder.

I think about the timeline. Fifty-five months. Eight months purchased with the Martinez fee, eight months that depend on delivering a successful integration package, eight months that are evaporating in front of me as the extraction destabilizes.

I think about reporting this. The Authority has protocols for data corruption. Technical teams who handle anomalies. If I flag the Martinez archive as compromised, they'll investigate. They'll suspend my access. They'll review my other extractions, looking for signs of contamination, looking for the shape in files I've already delivered.

They'll find it. I know this without knowing how I know. The shape isn't just in Martinez. The shape is in Vasquez. The shape is in every extraction I've done since I first saw it in that conference photograph—or maybe before that, maybe it's been in my work since the beginning, nested in my methods like the code is nested in the data.

If they find it, they'll suspend my license. Investigation pending. Timeline frozen. Fifty-five months becoming fifty-five years, becoming never, becoming a death that stays dead.

I could hide it.

The thought arrives fully formed, as if someone else placed it in my mind. I could close the folder. Restore the extraction from backup. Deliver the Martinez package with the shape excised, with the code removed, with no mention in my report of the anomaly I've been tracking since Vasquez. The children will get their father. The Authority will get their fee. I'll get eight months closer to the threshold.

And the shape will still be here. In my work. In my methods. In the cold that won't leave my hands.

---

The visualization changes.

The code stops propagating. The extraction metrics stabilize at 71%—salvageable, with enough manual reconstruction. The shape in the projection field pulses once, twice, and then begins to fade.

But not completely. Not like before. This time it doesn't vanish when I stop looking at it. This time it settles into the edges of the display, into the periphery of my vision, into the space between the data clusters where nothing should render.

It's watching me.

The thought is insane and I think it anyway. The shape is watching me decide. The shape knows what choice I face—report and lose everything, hide and keep the timeline intact—and the shape is waiting to see what I do.

My hands have stopped tracing. They rest on the desk, numb and cold, fingers curved in a position that might be relaxation or might be the beginning of the spiral. I look at them and I cannot tell which.

The server room hums around me. The drives click and whir. The climate control cycles through its endless maintenance of temperature and humidity, keeping the dead alive in their magnetic tombs.

I am keeping the dead alive. That's my job. That's what the timeline is for—so that someday I can join them, can become data myself, can persist in the pattern even after the water changes.

But the shape suggests something else. The code suggests something else. The temporal impossibility of my methods appearing twenty years before I invented them suggests that persistence might not work the way the Authority claims, that the pattern might not be as linear as the marketing materials promise.

*// the reader is the writer*
*// the writer is the reader*

The comment from the first fragment. The line I found in the Vasquez extraction and again in Martinez, the line that suggests a loop rather than a line, a recursion rather than a progression.

If I am going to write this code—if this code exists because I will write it, because I have always been going to write it—then the timeline doesn't matter. Not in the way I thought. The fifty-five months, the countdown, the desperate race toward a threshold that keeps moving—none of it protects me from what's already happened. None of it prevents what I've already done.

My phone buzzes.

Lena. Her message glows on the screen: *Still working? It's almost 4.*

I stare at the words. They're real. Immediate. The texture of a present moment that exists outside the temporal vertigo of the code, outside the loop the shape is tracing around my awareness.

*Almost done*, I type back. The lie comes easily. I've been lying about this since Vasquez. One more lie is just continuation.

*Don't forget Saturday*, she replies. *Your mom's birthday. I'm bringing wine.*

Saturday. Mom turning seventy. Lena meeting my family. Marcus watching us with that expression of solving puzzles he hasn't been given all the pieces for.

All of it real. All of it waiting in the future that still feels like a future, even though the code in the Martinez data suggests that futures might be more complicated than arrival, that time might be something you can excavate the same way you excavate a dead man's consciousness.

I close my phone. The shape waits at the edge of my vision.

Report or hide. Ethics or survival. The choice that isn't really a choice because the shape is already in my work, already in my methods, already part of whatever pattern I've been weaving since I first started excavating the dead.

I open the extraction interface. Pull up the backup from three hours ago. Begin the painstaking work of restoring the Martinez data to something deliverable, excising the anomaly, cleaning the timeline of evidence.

The shape watches. The shape knows.

Somewhere in the code, in the fragments that predate my birth and the methods I haven't invented yet, something continues to wait with patience I cannot name, with certainty that precedes my decisions because it already knows what I'll choose, has always known, because the choosing and the living are the same operation folded over itself.

My hands are cold. The spiral continues at the edge of my awareness. The Martinez extraction runs in the projection field, rebuilding itself around a center that is no longer stable.

I keep working. The threshold is fifty-five months away. The shape is everywhere, and nowhere, and here.

I tell myself I'll report it tomorrow. I tell myself the hiding is temporary.

The code in the data knows what I'll actually do. The code has always known.

I trace the spiral on the desk, and the tracing feels like writing, and the writing feels like being written.

The server room hums. The dead persist in their archives. And the shape—the geometry that refuses to close, the pattern that knows my methods better than I do—the shape waits for me to understand what I've already become.

I don't understand yet.

But I will. The code promises that too.

*// excavator note: understanding arrives*
*// (the reader is already the reader)*
*// continue: next_layer*

I close my eyes. The shape burns behind my eyelids, persistent as memory, inevitable as the future that is also the past.

Saturday is three days away. Mom is turning seventy. Lena will meet my family.

And the shape will still be here, woven into my work, waiting for the recognition that has already occurred in some timeline I can't access yet.

I open my eyes. Get back to work.

The extraction won't finish itself.
