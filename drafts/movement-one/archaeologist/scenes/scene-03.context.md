## Scene Accomplishments

### Worldbuilding Established

- Authority price adjustment: 6% increase across all packages (55 months becomes 57)
- Mortality statistics: most people who reach 70 without threshold never reach it
- Integration economics: people die "the old way" for 100,000 years; now only the wealthy can afford preservation
- Service workers (line cooks, dishwashers) as those who will never reach threshold

### Character Development

- **Marcus**: Twin brother (11 minutes apart), 34 years old, line cook, resigned rather than weathered, lives in immediate present, challenges the Archaeologist's obsessive future-focus, asks real questions about what happens if the threshold is never reached
- **Lena**: Lost someone who "didn't know" about mortality; motivates her work; agrees to meet Archaeologist's family; relationship deepened to "essential" but still undefined
- **Archaeologist**: Forgot mother's 70th birthday; timeline obsession blocking present existence; considers "stopping" the race; describes Lena as "essential"; beginning to question whether mortality might be acceptable
- **Mother (background)**: Turning 70, never talks about integration, unknown if she's saved anything for threshold

### Voice Confirmed

- Present tense maintained throughout
- Tactile grounding: coffee temperature, server room hum, cold air, desk surface, damp sidewalk
- Economic pressure persistent: 6% increase, months erased, can't afford to save both himself and mother
- Physical sensations: shape at edge of awareness, humming in chest

### Relationship Stakes

- Archaeologist invites Lena to family dinner (Saturday, Mom's 70th birthday)
- Marcus watching them "like he's solving a puzzle"
- Lena asks "What would I be introduced as?" - the relationship remains undefined after 3 years
- "Essential" as the Archaeologist's word for what they are

### Protocol Thread Progression

- More anomalous code discovered in Martinez data (KL-7 signature)
- Visualization protocol triggers automatically—the shape becomes clearer than ever seen
- Shape "holds attention like gravity holds mass"
- Deja vu moment: "I've seen this before... both are true, and neither makes sense"
- Code "older than me and written in my hand"

## Rhymes Used

| Rhyme | Category | Moment |
|-------|----------|--------|
| deja-vu-that-isnt | cognitive | "I've seen this before. Not in files, not in data—seen it in some deeper way, some overlap of moments that refuses to resolve into sequence" |

Total: 1 rhyme (appropriate for Movement One intensity)

## Genre Markers Present

- **Morgue atmosphere**: Server room cold, infrastructure keeping the dead alive, recycled air
- **Intimate invasion**: Hands moving through Martinez data, flagging emotional anchors
- **Economic predation**: Price adjustments, threshold calculations, mom can't afford integration
- **Decay beneath polish**: Lines around Marcus's eyes, aging without weathering
- **Isolation despite density**: Working adjacent but not together, undefined relationship, birthday forgotten

---

## Continuity Notes

### From Scene 02
- Martinez extraction continues (73% complete by end of scene)
- Lena relationship deepened from "not-quite accidental" to explicit invitation
- Cold hands/server room chill referenced but not overwrought
- Anomalous code discovered—now expands with visualization protocol

### Setup for Scene 04
- Shape "always waits now" at edge of awareness
- Code "continues to wait—patient, impossible"
- Birthday dinner on Saturday creates temporal deadline
- Marcus's challenge to "actually live now" creates internal tension
- Foreshadowing: "the pattern that predates my existence waits for me to understand"

### Marcus Thread
- Accepts mortality as "natural"
- 3 AM text conversation deepens his philosophy: "Maybe you can want to live forever AND actually live now"
- Watching Archaeologist/Lena relationship "like he's solving a puzzle"
- Will be present at birthday dinner in future scene

---

## Drafting Notes

- Opened with Marcus video call to ground the relational stakes immediately
- Mother's birthday creates external deadline/pressure beyond the integration timeline
- Lena scene in middle provides breathing room and relationship definition attempt
- Late-night text exchange with Marcus allows philosophical dialogue without breaking voice
- Shape encounter at 2 AM placed strategically—after emotional scenes, before Marcus's challenge
- Ending walks the line between Marcus's "try to be here" advice and the shape's persistent presence
- "Essential" as relationship label mirrors integration language—people as data, value, preservation
- Sidewalk footsteps metaphor: "evidence of presence that doesn't persist"—mortality made tactile
