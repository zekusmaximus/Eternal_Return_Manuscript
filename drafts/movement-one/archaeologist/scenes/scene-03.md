# Lena and Marcus

Marcus calls while I'm three layers deep in the Martinez extraction.

My brother's face fills the secondary display—grainy, poorly lit, the background murky with kitchen equipment I can barely make out. He's on break at whatever job he's working this month. Line cook. Dishwasher. Something that pays by the hour and doesn't require thinking about tomorrow.

"You look like hell," he says.

"Thanks." I don't minimize the Martinez visualization. Let him see the galaxy of files, the dense clusters of emotional data, the work that keeps me fifty-five months from threshold instead of sixty-three. "You called for a reason?"

"Mom's birthday." He wipes his hands on something off-screen. "You coming?"

The question catches me off guard. I'd forgotten. I've forgotten a lot of dates lately—the calendar in my head has room for extraction deadlines and integration milestones, for the countdown that matters, but birthdays slide past like data I haven't tagged for preservation.

"When?"

"Saturday. Three days." He laughs, but there's no humor in it. "You forgot."

"I've been working."

"You're always working." The kitchen noise swells behind him—shouting, the clatter of metal on metal, the hiss of something hitting a hot surface. His world is all immediate sensation, no archives, no afterlife. "She's turning seventy, man. Seventy. How many more you think she's got?"

The number lands harder than he intends. I think of Eleanor Vasquez—seventy-three when she died, her children pooling their inheritance to afford what she couldn't save for herself. I think of the integration timeline, the way prices keep climbing, the statistical reality that most people who reach seventy without threshold never reach it at all.

"I'll be there," I say. "Saturday. What time?"

"Dinner. Six." He leans closer to the camera, and I see the lines around his eyes that weren't there a year ago. We're the same age—thirty-four, born eleven minutes apart—but Marcus looks older now. Not weathered. Resigned. "You could bring someone, you know. If there's someone to bring."

He means Lena. He's met her twice—once at a holiday gathering I couldn't avoid, once when he showed up at the server facility unannounced and found her at the adjacent station. Both times he'd watched us interact with the expression of someone solving a puzzle he hadn't been given all the pieces for.

"I'll ask."

"You do that." The kitchen noise spikes again—someone yelling about temperatures, about timing. His world runs on immediacy. Mine runs on preservation. "Listen, I gotta go. But Saturday. Be there."

"I will."

"And eat something before then. You look like a corpse." He grins, and for a moment I see the kid he used to be—the one who didn't worry about timelines, who lived like forever was guaranteed. "Later, bro."

The screen goes dark. The Martinez data pulses in the projection field, waiting for my attention.

Seventy. Mom's turning seventy, and I don't know if she's saved anything for integration. I don't know if Marcus has ever asked. The conversation we don't have, the three of us—the one about who gets preserved and who gets left behind, about what happens to family when some of them become data and some of them stay dust.

I turn back to the extraction. The work doesn't care about birthday dinners. The work only cares about pattern integrity.

My hands move through the Martinez data—flagging emotional anchors, tagging correspondence for sentiment analysis, building the scaffold that will hold a dead man's personality together when they try to resurrect him. Standard procedure. I do it on autopilot now, the muscle memory of hundreds of excavations, while some other part of me replays Marcus's face. The resignation in his eyes. The way he called me "bro" at the end, the childhood shorthand we rarely use anymore.

Seventy. The number echoes. Mom never talks about integration—never asks about my timeline, never comments on the work I do. Maybe she thinks it's ghoulish. Maybe she's decided mortality is preferable to whatever we're selling. Maybe she just doesn't want to have the conversation where I tell her I can't afford to save us both.

Lena arrives at her usual time, coffee in hand, but tonight she doesn't approach my station.

I notice her at the doorway first—a presence that changes the room's pressure, a shift in the air that draws my attention. She stands there for almost a minute before I look up, and when I do, her expression is complicated in ways I've learned to read over three years of parallel work.

"You heard from the Authority," I say. Not a question.

"Price adjustment." She crosses to her own station, sets the coffee down between us—equidistant, neither mine nor hers. "Effective next quarter. Six percent across all packages."

The math happens automatically. Six percent on my current projection—fifty-five months becomes fifty-seven. Two months erased. Two months of Martinez money absorbed back into the gap that never seems to close.

"Maintenance fees?"

"Included. The base rate and the ongoing costs." She pulls up her own interface, begins scrolling through files I can't see from here. "They're framing it as infrastructure improvements. Better redundancy. Enhanced consciousness stability."

"They're framing it as profit."

"They're framing it as survival." Her voice is flat. The voice she uses when she's processing something she hasn't decided how to feel about yet. "The facilities in Finland are expanding. The server farms, the cooling systems, the backup arrays. All of it costs money that has to come from somewhere."

"And it comes from us."

"It comes from people who want to live forever." She finally looks at me, and her eyes are the color of exhausted certainty. "We knew the timeline was a moving target. We've always known."

I think about Marcus, wiping his hands on a dirty towel, asking if I'm bringing someone to Mom's birthday. I think about the line cooks and dishwashers and service workers who will never see the threshold, who will die the old way, the way humanity died for a hundred thousand years before integration became possible.

"Do you ever think about stopping?"

The question comes out before I've decided to ask it. Lena's hands freeze on her interface.

"Stopping what?"

"The race. The saving. The constant calculation of how many months, how many years, how much everything costs." I gesture at the Martinez data still pulsing in my projection field—sixty-one years of a man's existence, compressed into clusters I can manipulate with a thought. "What if we just... stopped trying? Accepted that the threshold is always going to be ahead of us?"

"Then we die." Simple. Direct. The way Lena handles everything. "We die and nothing continues. No pattern, no persistence, no wave moving through different water. Just—ending."

"Marcus would say that's natural."

"Marcus isn't excavating the dead for a living." She picks up her coffee, drinks, sets it down again in exactly the same spot. "Marcus doesn't know what it feels like to hold someone's entire existence in your hands and understand that you could lose it. That it could just... stop existing. Gone like it was never there."

"Maybe that's easier. Not knowing."

"Maybe." She turns back to her interface, and I watch her profile in the soft glow of whatever data she's processing. The line of her jaw, the set of her shoulders, the way her fingers move through information with a precision that comes from years of practice. "But I lost someone who didn't know. Who thought mortality was fine, was natural, was just how things worked. And when he was gone—"

She stops. I wait.

"When he was gone, there was nothing left. No archive, no pattern, no way to hear his voice or understand what he'd been thinking in those last months. Just absence. Just a hole where a person used to be." Her hands have stopped moving. The data waits. "I'd rather spend my whole life chasing a threshold I never reach than accept that kind of ending."

The silence stretches between us. The server room hums its constant mechanical prayer—fans and drives and the cold infrastructure that keeps the dead alive.

"My mother's turning seventy," I say finally. "Marcus called. Birthday dinner on Saturday."

"You should go."

"I was wondering if you'd come with me."

The question lands differently than I expected. Lena turns, and something in her expression shifts—not surprise, exactly, but recalibration. The look she gets when data doesn't match her initial mapping.

"Meet your family?"

"You've met Marcus. Twice."

"I've met Marcus. I haven't met your mother. I haven't been introduced as—" She pauses, searching for the right word. "What would I be introduced as?"

"A colleague."

"We're more than colleagues."

"A friend, then."

"Are we?" She's not challenging—she's genuinely asking. Three years of parallel work, of coffee timed to my patterns, of hands that brush shoulders in ways that are not quite accidental. Three years of not defining what we are. "I don't know what we are. I know what we do. I know how we work. But I don't know what you'd call it if someone asked."

I think about it. Really think, for the first time in months that have been consumed by extraction and optimization and the relentless countdown of my remaining time.

"I'd call it essential," I say. "I'd say you're essential."

The word hangs in the cold air. Lena's mouth does something complicated—the same expression she had when I made the bad joke about sleeping when I'm integrated.

"Essential." She tastes the word like she's evaluating its emotional signature. "That's a very excavator thing to say."

"I'm a very excavator person."

"You are." She reaches for her coffee again, and this time her fingers brush the back of my hand as she does. Not accidental. Intentional. A small intimacy in a room full of the dead. "Saturday. What time?"

"Six."

"I'll be there."

The Martinez extraction hits a wall at 2 AM.

I've been working through his forties—the decade of expansion, of acquisition, of the humanitarian profiteering that made his children rich enough to fight over his estate. The data is dense here, emotionally layered, full of the complex signatures that make integration difficult but possible.

And then I find the folder.

It sits in a subdirectory I almost missed—labeled with a date that means nothing, nested three levels deep in routine correspondence files. But when I open it, the visualization changes. The data reshapes itself around a new center of gravity.

Code. More code. The same impossible code I found in the first extraction, the KL-7 signature that predates my career, the methods I invented before I was born.

But this time there's something else. A file that isn't code—or isn't only code. A visualization protocol that triggers automatically when I access it.

The shape blooms in the projection field.

Something in the geometry feels familiar—a resonance with Eleanor Vasquez's photograph, with the spirals I draw on desks without deciding to. But I've never seen it this clearly—this directly. A topology that defies the mapping algorithm, lines winding toward each other without touching, a structure that suggests dimensions my software shouldn't be able to render.

I try to look away and find that I can't. The shape holds my attention like gravity holds mass—not force, just the natural consequence of presence. A geometry that refuses direct observation—the more I focus, the more it seems to slip sideways, occupying spaces my vision can't quite reach.

The feeling arrives mid-observation: I've seen this before. Not in files, not in data—seen it in some deeper way, some overlap of moments that refuses to resolve into sequence. I've been here before. I'm being here now. Both are true, and neither makes sense.

A chill runs through me—not the server room's ambient cold, but something deeper. The sensation settles into my chest, the space behind my sternum where something begins to hum.

I close the file. The shape vanishes. The humming fades.

But my finger is tracing something on the desk surface—a spiral I recognize without knowing how. I've been doing it for minutes, maybe longer.

The Martinez data waits in the projection field. Standard extraction. Standard work. Nothing unusual to report.

I report nothing unusual.

Marcus texts at 3 AM: *You still awake?*

I stare at my phone's glow in the dim server room. My brother, awake at 3 AM after a restaurant shift, probably just home, probably too wired to sleep. My brother, who doesn't calculate his remaining time because he's decided there's nothing to calculate toward.

*Working*, I reply.

*Of course you are.* Then, a moment later: *Can I ask you something?*

*Go ahead.*

The typing indicator pulses for a long time. Whatever he's writing, he's editing it. Reconsidering. My brother who lives in the immediate present, trying to find words for something that matters.

*Do you ever think about what happens if you don't make it? Like not in a dark way. Just—what if all the saving and the working and the sacrificing doesn't get you there? What if you spend your whole life chasing the threshold and you die at sixty-two months out?*

The question is a knife I didn't see coming. I read it twice, three times, trying to find the angle of attack.

*I try not to think about it.*

*That's the problem.* Another long pause. More editing. *You're so focused on making it that you're not actually living. You're not HERE. You're always somewhere in the future, some version of yourself that got integrated, that escaped. But what about the version that's sitting in a server room at 3 AM missing his mom's birthday?*

*I'm not missing it. I said I'd be there.*

*You forgot it existed until I called.*

That lands. I don't have a response.

*I'm not saying the threshold is bad*, Marcus continues. *I'm not saying you should give up or whatever. I'm saying maybe there's something in between. Maybe you can save for the future AND exist in the present. Maybe you can want to live forever AND actually live now.*

I think about Lena's hand brushing mine. I think about the essential I'd offered her, the word that was both too much and not enough. I think about the shape in the data, the code that knows my methods before I invent them, the cold that won't leave my hands.

*Maybe*, I type.

*Try*, he replies. *For Mom's birthday. Just try to be there. Actually there. Not thinking about extraction timelines or integration fees or whatever the hell you think about when you're pretending to listen.*

*I'll try.*

*Good.* Then: *Get some sleep, weirdo. You look like death.*

*You said corpse earlier.*

*Corpse, death, same family.* A laughing emoji. Then nothing.

I put the phone down. The server room hums around me, the cold air cycling through systems designed to keep data alive.

The shape persists. Not the visualization—that's closed, buried in a quarantine folder I'll deal with later. But something lingers. In the shadows between equipment. In the space behind my own eyes. A geometry that knows me better than I know myself.

I close my workstation. Log my hours. Leave the Martinez extraction at 73% complete—good progress, nothing unusual.

The elevator takes me down through the building's concrete bones. The lobby is empty at this hour, just security lights and the distant hum of infrastructure keeping the dead alive. I walk through it and feel something following me—a presence that refuses to resolve into anything I can name.

Saturday. Mom's birthday. Lena will be there. Marcus will be watching us like he's solving a puzzle.

And somewhere in the data, the code waits. The shape waits. The pattern that predates my existence waits for me to understand what it's been trying to tell me.

I step out into the gray pre-dawn. The city smells of recycled air and exhaust and the distant promise of rain. Real smells. Present smells. The texture of a world that hasn't been compressed into clusters and signatures and emotional anchors.

I breathe it in. Try to be here. Actually here.

The sidewalk is damp. My footsteps leave temporary marks that evaporate behind me—evidence of presence that doesn't persist. No one will excavate these footsteps. No one will tag them for emotional significance. They exist for a moment and then they're gone.

Maybe that's what Marcus means. Maybe that's what mortality feels like when you're not fighting it.

The shape waits at the edge of my awareness. It always waits now.

I start walking home. Saturday is three days away. Mom will turn seventy. Lena will meet my family. Marcus will watch us and see something I can't see.

And somewhere in a server room, the code continues to wait—patient, impossible, older than me and written in my hand.

I walk faster. The gray light strengthens. The city wakes around me, full of people who will never reach the threshold, people who will die the old way, people who might be happier for it.

I don't know if I'm one of them.

I keep walking.
