# Scene Context: m1-arch-04 "The Anomaly"

## Scene Accomplishments

1. **Phantasm First Encounter**: The shape breaks containment from the quarantined folder, appearing undeniably in the Martinez extraction. Cannot be closed or quarantined—spreads through multiple files simultaneously.

2. **Recognition Through Work**: The Archaeologist recognizes the pattern through professional disruption rather than resemblance. The shape appears IN his methods, using his techniques against him. The KL-7 code employs methods he hasn't invented yet.

3. **Professional Crisis**: The encounter forces a choice between reporting (ethical, timeline-destroying) and hiding (survival, ethical breach). He chooses to hide, beginning the restoration from backup.

4. **Temporal Vertigo**: The KL-7 code's use of future techniques creates intensified déjà vu—not just "I've seen this" but "I am doing this and have done this" simultaneously. Time collapses.

5. **Physical Escalation**: Cold hands worsen throughout, spreading from hands to forearms to shoulders to chest. Tracing becomes compulsive. Body responds to the pattern before mind understands.

## Rhymes Used

- **phantasm-first-encounter** (CRITICAL): Shape breaks through visualization, refuses containment, spreads through files, watches the Archaeologist decide
- **cold-hands**: Progression from hands to arms to shoulders to chest, spreading through the scene
- **almost-closed-curve**: The shape's topology, curves approaching without meeting
- **tracing-the-form**: Compulsive, unconscious tracing that matches the visualization
- **déjà-vu-that-isn't**: Temporal overlap intensifies—past/present/future collapsing
- **blue-white-light**: Interface glow, color of data and work

## Validation Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Voice | warn | Tense distribution (present/past) flagged; matches other scenes |
| Philosophy | pass | No shackle violations; recognition through intensity, not resemblance |
| Rhyme | warn | Higher rhyme density for phantasm scene (6 found); justified by critical encounter |
| Genre | pass | Corporate Gothic markers present (economic anxiety, technology failing) |

## Continuity Notes

### Elements Referenced
- Martinez extraction at 89%, then destabilizing to 71%
- Timeline: 55 months (from scene 03)
- KL-7 code pattern found previously in Vasquez and Martinez
- Cold hands worsening from scene 02
- Quarantined folder from scene 03
- Lena's Saturday birthday plans (from scene 03)
- Tracing the spiral unconsciously (established scenes 01-03)

### Elements Introduced
- Shape breaks quarantine containment
- Code uses future techniques (temporal recursion)
- Professional choice: report vs hide
- Archaeologist chooses to hide (ethical breach)
- Shape is "watching" him decide
- Physical manifestation spreads inward (hands → arms → chest)

### Setup for Scene 05
- Hiding the anomaly creates ethical complicity
- Shape persists "at the edge of vision"
- Restoration from backup is ongoing
- Lena may notice changes in Saturday scene
- Recognition that "the code has always known" what he'll choose

## Drafting Decisions

### Recognition Mode
Distinguished from other threads:
- Algorithm: Mutual perception ("the shape perceives me")
- Last Human: Geographic presence (arriving at the place always walked toward)
- **Archaeologist: Professional disruption** (tools/methods/work becoming unreliable)

### Professional Crisis Structure
The shape creates a scenario where ALL options threaten the timeline:
- Report → investigation → work suspended → timeline extends
- Hide → ethical breach → if discovered, career ends
- Complete with anomaly → quality compromised → reputation damaged

Chose to have him hide, establishing:
- Character flaw (willing to compromise ethics for survival)
- Complicity with the pattern
- Setup for escalation in scene 05

### Voice Maintenance
Maintained Archaeologist distinctions:
- Dense paragraphs (no fragments after edit)
- Present-tense active throughout
- Tactile grounding (cold, hardware, physical sensation)
- Economic anxiety (timeline calculations woven through)
- Technology failing (quarantine breaks, visualization persists, extraction destabilizes)

### Phantasm Encounter Execution
The shape:
- Arrives through professional work (Martinez extraction)
- Breaks containment (escapes quarantine, spreads through files)
- Uses his methods against him (KL-7 code predates his existence)
- Creates temporal overlap (déjà vu that isn't just déjà vu)
- Forces professional crisis (no neutral response possible)
- Manifests physically (cold spreads, tracing compulsive, humming in chest)
- Is undeniable (cannot be closed, cannot be ignored, persists at edge of vision)
