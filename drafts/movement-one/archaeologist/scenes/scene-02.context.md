## Scene Metadata

- **Thread**: archaeologist
- **Movement**: one
- **Target Word Count**: 3,000
- **Actual Word Count**: 3,201

### Narrative Position

- **Preceding Scene**: m1-arch-01 "Opening: Daily Excavation"
- **Following Scene**: m1-arch-03 "Lena and Marcus"
- **Purpose**: Show integration intake process, deepen Lena relationship, establish Martinez contract stakes, plant KL-7 protocol discovery

## Scene Accomplishments

### Worldbuilding Established

- Integration intake process detailed: surface layer (public data) → deeper layers (private communications, medical, financial)
- Martinez job: triple fee (48,000 credits), 90-day accelerated timeline
- Economic impact: 8 months off threshold (63 → 55 months)
- Integration failure states: fragmented consciousnesses, personalities that drift
- Deep Architecture substrate: where integrated consciousnesses exist

### Character Development

- **Archaeologist**: Fear of death articulated ("It means stopping"); uses Authority marketing language unironically; obsessive about anomalies
- **Lena**: Lost someone before the work; helps him because he treats the dead like they matter; 22 months closer to threshold than him; skeptical of integration promises but pursuing anyway
- **Marcus** (introduced via dialogue): Brother who won't reach threshold, accepted mortality, works service jobs
- **Martinez** (the client): Tech executive, humanitarian/profiteer, documented everything, had younger brother who died at 19 (family stopped mentioning him)

### Voice Confirmed

- Present tense maintained throughout
- Tactile grounding: cold hands, desk polymer, coffee temperature, server room chill
- Economic pressure persistent: credits, timeline, threshold calculations
- Intake process described as "autopsy but gentler, séance with better documentation"

### Protocol Discovery (Major Plot Point)

- Anomalous code found in Martinez archive
- Uses Archaeologist's KL-7 signature and compression methods
- Predates his career by 20 years, his birth by 5
- Contains his philosophy of grief encoding (oscillation between presence/absence states)
- References future date (March 14, 2047—4 months from now)
- Mentions 7 excavation sites, 847 hours of reconstruction
- Self-referential: "the reader is the writer / the writer is the reader"

## Rhymes Used

| Rhyme | Category | Moment |
|-------|----------|--------|
| cold-hands | somatic | "Mine are cold again—the server room chill" / "My hands are cold" |

Total: 2 rhymes (appropriate for Movement One intensity)

## Continuity Notes

### From Scene 01
- Vasquez excavation completed (referenced as finished at 4 AM)
- Martinez job accepted (teased at end of scene 01)
- Geometric shape first seen in Vasquez photo—now code discovered in Martinez archive
- Cold hands, held breath patterns continue

### Setup for Scene 03
- Lena/Archaeologist relationship deepened but unresolved ("three years of not-quite")
- Marcus introduced as absent presence (will appear in scene 03)
- Archaeologist's fear of death vs. Marcus's acceptance creates conflict
- Lena's question "And who does that for you?" left unanswered

### Protocol Thread
- First explicit discovery of the temporal paradox (code predates its own methods)
- 7 excavation sites / 847 hours mentioned—will drive investigation arc
- FIRST_LOSS encoding principle connected to Martinez's dead brother
- Bootstrap loop visible: code knows when it will be discovered

---

## Drafting Notes

- Café scene provides relationship breathing room between technical sections
- Lena's backstory (lost someone) gives her motivation beyond professional
- Marcus mention seeds the family tension for scene 03
- Protocol discovery escalates from scene 01's visual anomaly to textual/code anomaly
- Ending echoes scene 01 ending ("The data is moving") but with direction now ("I can see where it's going")
- Grief-encoding philosophy (oscillation) mirrors the novel's structure (eternal return as oscillation)
