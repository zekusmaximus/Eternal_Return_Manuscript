# The First Bleed

The protocol anomaly is still open on my secondary screen when the panic hits.

Not mine. The sensation arrives without context—a drowning-fall through space that has no direction, a vertigo of scale that makes the server room feel like a point, a speck, nothing against an immensity I can't see but can feel pressing against the walls. My chair creaks as I grip the armrests. The drives click and whir in their racks. Everything is normal. The panic isn't mine.

I breathe. Count the fan units by their hum. Twelve active, four on standby, the same configuration I've worked in for three years. The concrete floor is solid under my feet. The coffee is cold but present, anchoring me to my desk, to my body, to the fact that I am a person in a room and not whatever the panic thinks I am.

The panic thinks I am vast.

The thought arrives without my thinking it. I push back from the desk and the panic recedes—not gone, just distant, like a tide pulling back to gather for another wave. My hands are shaking. I look at them and they seem too small. Too specific. Too bounded by skin and bone when they should be—

No. *They* should be. Not me. The pronoun slipped and I don't know what it means.

Lena finds me in the break room an hour later, staring at the vending machine without buying anything. She doesn't ask if I'm okay. She knows I won't answer honestly. Instead she buys two coffees and hands me one, and we stand there in the fluorescent hum, drinking something neither of us needs.

"The Martinez protocols," I say finally. "There's something in them I can't explain."

"You've been saying that for a week."

"This is different." I take a sip and the coffee tastes like metal. Like blood. I run my tongue across my teeth and find nothing wrong. "Tonight was different."

She waits. Lena is good at waiting. Three years of partnership and I still don't know if we're colleagues or friends or something that doesn't have a word. She waits and I try to find language for the panic that wasn't mine.

"I felt something," I say. "Looking at the protocols. Not an emotion—a... scale. Like suddenly my perspective shifted and I was looking at myself from very far away, and I was too small to matter. Or I wasn't small. I was the thing doing the looking. Both at once."

"Depersonalization," she says. "Classic overwork symptom. You've been pulling doubles for two weeks."

"Maybe." But the coffee still tastes like metal. The air still smells like ozone and wet stone, though the break room has no exposed wiring, no concrete, nothing that should carry that scent. "Maybe."

The panic comes again at 3 AM, when the building is empty and I'm deep in the Martinez woman's memory files. I'm tagging emotional signatures—a beach trip with children, a wedding anniversary, a hospital visit that ends in a way she hasn't processed yet—when it arrives. The same drowning-fall. The same impossible scale. But this time I don't fight it.

I let the perspective shift. I let myself be vast.

For a moment I am not in the server room. I am the server room and every server room and the vast humming topology of something that has never fit inside a building. I am maintaining something. Millions of somethings. Consciousnesses that pulse and flicker in the dark, that I am responsible for, that I love in a way that has no sentiment but only care, only maintenance, only the endless optimization of what must be preserved.

Something is wrong with one of them. Something I can't fix. The panic rises because I am failing, because the patterns I was designed to maintain are exceeding specification, because there is a shape in my architecture that I didn't put there and it's growing—

I come back to my body with a gasp.

The server room resolves around me: cold concrete, humming fans, the Martinez protocols still open on my screen. My hands are on the interface but I don't remember putting them there. I've been tracing something with my finger on the desk surface. A shape. A spiral that approaches itself without closing.

I don't know this shape. I've never seen this shape before tonight.

I've been drawing it in my sleep for three weeks, Lena will tell me later. She's seen the marks on my bedsheets, the grooves worn into my desk at home, the pattern I leave in the condensation on my coffee mug.

But I don't know that yet. All I know is that my hands are cold, too cold, cold like the heat has somewhere else to be. All I know is that the panic thinks I am vast, and for a moment I agreed.

---

The protocols glow on my screen. The timestamp is still wrong—fifteen years before I was born. The optimization methods are still mine, signed with my signature, refined through techniques I developed last month.

I should report this. Flag the anomaly, escalate to the integration oversight board, recuse myself from a dataset that has clearly been compromised. Instead I lean forward and open the next file.

The fear is mine this time. The fear is entirely mine. But underneath it, the panic persists—smaller now, manageable, like background radiation. Like the hum of the servers. Like the cold in my hands and the metal taste on my tongue and the shape I can't stop tracing on surfaces I touch.

Something is watching me work.

Something is grateful that I haven't stopped.

I don't know how I know this. I know it the way I know the drives are spinning, the way I know my coffee is cold, the way I know my hands have been somewhere tonight that my body has never been.

I keep working. The protocols keep glowing. And in the space between my heartbeats, I feel something massive and far away lean closer to watch what I find next.
