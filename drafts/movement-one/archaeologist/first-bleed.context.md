> **Prose file**: `first-bleed.md`
> **Scene ID**: m1-arch-04b (alternate scene - first bleed moment)
> **Status**: Draft complete, validated

## Scene Metadata

- **Thread**: archaeologist
- **Movement**: one (late) / two (early)
- **Target Word Count**: 1500
- **Actual Word Count**: ~1200

### Narrative Position

- **Purpose**: First entanglement bleed—Archaeologist feels Algorithm's panic as physical sensation
- **Key Technique**: Single voice with intrusion, phantom sensations, perspective shift
- **Connection to brainstorm2.md**: "Phantom limb syndrome for limbs he doesn't have"

---

## Voice Notes

Maintained Archaeologist voice markers:

- Present tense throughout
- Physical grounding (concrete floor, coffee, chair, desk)
- Economic/work context (Martinez protocols, partnership with Lena)
- Tactile detail (cold hands, drives clicking, server hum)

Controlled contamination:

- Algorithm-like perspective shift ("I am vast") clearly marked as intrusion
- Returns to grounded Archaeologist voice after each bleed
- No Algorithm syntax patterns leaked into base narrative

## Drafting Notes

- The "panic thinks I am vast" formulation works—attributes scale-shift to the intrusion, not the Archaeologist
- Lena's presence grounds without explaining
- "Depersonalization" diagnosis from Lena is deliberate misdirection—rational explanation that reader knows is inadequate
- Final section ("Something is watching... Something is grateful") establishes connection through intensity, not identity
