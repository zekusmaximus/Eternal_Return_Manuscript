## Movement Two Progress

### Cycle Structure

Movement Two uses a braided A-B-C rotation across three cycles:
- **Cycle 1**: Establishing the Condition
- **Cycle 2**: Deepening the Crisis ← **CURRENT**
- **Cycle 3**: Approaching the Threshold

### Scene Status

### Rhyme Handoff Chain (Movement Two)

```
Cycle 1: bone-frequency → cold-hands → tracing-the-form
Cycle 2: tracing-the-form → metallic-taste → name-edge-of-memory ← CURRENT
Cycle 3: sentence-without-origin → [stacking] → [augenblick-trigger]
```

## Key Narrative Developments (Movement Two)

### Cycle 1: Establishing the Condition
- Archaeologist: First major bleed event, Lena notices changes
- Algorithm: Cross-thread connection established, Mildred Higgins stable at 99.9%
- Last Human: Enters Archive, transformation persists

### Cycle 2: Deepening the Crisis
- Archaeologist: Lost time (5 hours), Lena confrontation, "Architect" emerges
- Algorithm: Mildred degrades (99.9% → 97.2%), pharmakon cost visible, mutual bleed
- Last Human: **PENDING** — Name feels wrong, speaks phrases without composing

### Cycle 3: Approaching the Threshold
- All scenes pending — Augenblick approaches
