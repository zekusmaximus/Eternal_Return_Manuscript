## Session Log

### 2026-01-12 (Session 2: Afternoon)

**Focus**: Voice samples and era worldbuilding

**Completed**:
- Created `voices/archaeologist.md` — sample passages, vocabulary, forbidden patterns, diagnostics
- Created `voices/algorithm.md` — tense-shifting examples, self-referential syntax, topological vocabulary
- Created `voices/last-human.md` — sparse/elegiac style, fragment usage, past-inflected present
- Created `worldbuilding/near-future.md` — integration industry, digital archaeology, climate decline, technology
- Created `worldbuilding/mid-future.md` — database state, Algorithm nature, temporal properties, consciousness-bleed
- Created `worldbuilding/deep-future.md` — post-catastrophe environment, ruins, the journey, the choice

**Infrastructure Now Complete**:
- [x] Manuscript manifest with scene structure
- [x] Revision workflow (6-pass system)
- [x] Templates (scene, character, voice-exercise, worldbuilding)
